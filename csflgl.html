    <p>
    The two bedroom apartment next to his had been vacant for almost two months now. Ryan had pretty much grown use to no one living there. Before a noisy couple had lived there who liked to perform kinky sex acts as far as he could tell. Either that or they were abusing each other. Ryan had never been sure and it had never been his place to butt in. Ryan Sandleton was a single twenty-six year old who lived alone in a two bedroom apartment. The second room served as an office that he used very often because his job was mainly done from home. He was in charge of a six man team that went from one retail outlet to another setting up displays and making sure that products were correctly displayed. It wasn't the greatest job but it was still a good job none-the-less.
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan was single, young and slightly not ambitious. He liked the job that he had because it was simple and gave him a lot of free time to pursue other interests. Namely talking with others like himself on the internet and surfing said internet for pictures. Ryan was not a collector of porn as he had discovered years ago that collecting the kind of porn he would have liked to see would send him directly to jail. Ryan Sandleton was a twenty-six year old lover of little girls. He had first discovered his attraction to preteen girls when he was eighteen and in his first year of college.
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan wasn't an ugly man, and there really wasn't anything abnormal about his appearance. He could have probably stood to loose a few pounds but it wasn't like he was hauling around forty pounds of extra weight. He had dark sandy brown hair and light green eyes. There was something strong and handsome about his face that he didn't quite know how to describe. His last serious girlfriend had said that it added a quality that most guys did not have. He was tall but not too tall coming in at six feet in height exactly. Usually Ryan wore sweatpants around the apartment when he was just relaxing.
    </p>
    <p>
    It wasn't like Ryan couldn't date girls his own age because he supposed that he could. There really was nothing stopping him other than the fact that most adult women did not turn him on. Ryan hadn't understood his condition at first. It had been something very hard for him to accept. It wasn't like he had wanted to be a pedophile it had just sort of, well, been discovered by him that he was one. He had been in his first year of college and enjoying a lot of the pursuits that a lot of college freshmen get stuck in. Parties were a weekly thing and Ryan often found himself at one party or another.
    </p>
    <p>
    It was at one frat party that this girl interested him. She was wearing a really tight halter top that showed off her very small breast. Up until this year he had always had a thing for very small breasted girls, and had thought that it was something that was just a part of who he was. After all men all seemed to have different tastes. Well this girl looked young as well and Ryan was probably a little tipsy so his reserved self had probably been a little bit gone. He had walked up to her asked her who she was and gotten to talk with her. About twenty minutes later they were upstairs in one of the frat house's bedrooms and they were having sex. The girl was no virgin in fact she appeared to know exactly what she wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan had learned the next morning when she was getting dressed that the girl was only fourteen and the little sister of one of the college girls at the party. She had "enjoyed" him and that was all that she would say. There were no phone calls after that or anything. The girl plain and simply just liked sex. Not that Ryan could blame her. But it had been that night, and with his inhibitions removed that Ryan had come to realize something about himself. He liked younger girls. There was nothing wrong with that but as the year continued on he realized he liked them really young.
    </p>
    <p>
    Like any lover of little girls he was afraid at first. He had kept his desires for young girls hidden from himself for so long. He had been afraid to admit the truth and it had been very hard to accept it as well. It wasn't like he slept with one fourteen year old and suddenly he just needed younger girls. It was the fourteen year old that opened his eyes. He had never realized it before but at the mall his eyes always roamed over the younger girls. Eleven, twelve, thirteen year old girls were always turning his eyes and his friends were always saying things like: "look at her!" To girls that really did nothing for him. Ryan had ignored his feelings because well they had scared him.
    </p>
    <p>
    After all everything he had ever learned about pedophiles had been from the media. They were evil abusive men and women who forced their attention on children, who raped children as well. It wasn't something he wanted to be. Perhaps he was a breed apart from most pedophiles? Perhaps he was that one abnormality that could never hurt a little girl? And it was little girls that he was attracted to. When he realized what he was he started to notice how much girls under eleven turned him on. About a month into his realization he had been in the mall alone and seen this cute girl about ten years of age in the music store. He had been unable to keep his eyes off of her. The girl had been fully flat; no breasts at all not even a hint. She had worn such tight jeans though that her little bottom was so perfectly defined. It had been impossible for him not to keep looking especially at her cute face. She had smiled at him almost acknowledging his looks but nothing else had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
    That had been the first realization to him that he liked girls without breasts. A little ten year old had filled his fantasies that night. Then he had started looking on the internet. There he found the newsgroups, the fiction stories, the model pictures. Little girls were everywhere it seemed. At first he thought for sure that even these model girls were being forced into something. Then he found the Bulletin Boards and others like himself. It amazed him. It totally blew the doors open. He wasn't one oddity in a sea of molesters and abusers. In fact it appeared, as he learned more and more, that the molesters and abusers were the oddities.
    </p>
    <p>
    He talked to many who were like him, those that had suppressed their desires and slowly come to learn what they were. Those that had known since they were children what their sexual orientation was. Those that had been abused as children, those that had actually enjoyed the sexual aspect of their relationship with an older man as a child. There were so many of them, some that had never even been abused. So many, more than he had ever imagined. They were everywhere like some secret underground organization that couldn't come above ground because society said they were evil.
    </p>
    <p>
    And their love for children, sometimes it astounded Ryan. It was so much like his own. They looked, they imagined, some of them even got close to little girls. A very small few even had sexual contact with young girls that willingly joined in with them. Most though just enjoyed being around little girls, talking to them, holding them even, or just spending quiet moments with the young girls. Most of them had never even done anything sexual with a little girl. But they all dreamed about it, and they all wished for the contact. Not the sexual contact either for the most part. Most girl lovers he talked to would welcome a sexual relationship with a little girl but only after months or years of knowing her. Most of them were overtly sensitive as well. More aware of the world around them.
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan realized that he was as well. He had always been very sensitive even as a child and every girl he had ever dated had always said how caring he was towards them. In high school there had even been a rumor that he was gay. It had never occurred to him, but it seemed as if most pedophiles could be misclassified as gay. Like most gay men, most male pedophiles it seemed were sensitive men who cared deeply. The main difference was that a girl lover understood and cared for little girls. It was strange being in this underground society. Men that had built their lives around lies because they needed to hide. Other men who couldn't even be in relationships with women because they couldn't deal with it all. Men who had wives who understood. There were even men who were fathers. Girl lovers who had daughters, some of them were even sexually attracted to their own daughters!
    Ryan was amazed and confounded by it all, but he had found those like himself. They weren't some minority of men and women, they were the majority. He realized now that child molesters were like rapists of adult women, or rapists of adult men, people who wanted control and who needed to be in control. They were the real sickos the ones that needed help. Being a pedophile was like being a homosexual it wasn't a choice, it was something Ryan had been born as. It was his sexual orientation and it wasn't going to change over night. So Ryan had to learn how to adapt to it. It took him six years to fully come to grips with who he was. During that time he got a good job and this apartment.

    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan sat back at his computer desk after typing one last word in a file and then sending it off to one of his men. Sometimes it was a pain being a boss. HE closed the program and on the back drop of his computer was a beautiful nine year old girl with a flower behind one of her ears. He smiled looking at the picture and then heard a noise outside. It sounded like someone dropped something. Ryan looked outside his window and his heart stopped for a full second. A girl was bending down outside his window picking up contents from a box. It wasn't so much that she was doing this that made his breath stop it was her face. . .
    </p>
    <p>
    She was carefully putting the objects back into the box and as she did Ryan looked at her. She had the most delicate looking features to her face. He couldn't see the color of her eyes, but as she turned to pick up more objects he could see all of her face. She had a small button nose, and a slightly heart shaped look to her face but not quiet and such small delicate looking features. Her lips were tiny but full, and her skin was a very pale white. She stood slowly and picked the box back up as she did Ryan got his first good look at the rest of her body. Her hair was dirty blonde and hung to about the middle of her back. She wore a sleeveless top with spaghetti straps and little flowers on the front of it. The top was tight enough against her for him to determine that she had yet to start developing. She wore very tight shorts as well and had such tiny little girl legs that he could have stared for hours. Her bottom was perfectly round and the shorts looked like they were about a size too big from the way that the holes at the bottom did not surround her legs, yet they were tight enough to show off her very round bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan felt like he had died and gone to heaven and he wondered who this little darling was. There were no little girls that lived in the complex. Then he heard someone form the apartment next door, "are you okay Celeste?"
    </p>
    <p>
    "I'm fine mom! I just dropped a box." Then the girl headed towards the apartment next to his. Ryan swallowed. . .god they were moving in next door to him. He pulled off his sweet pants and pulled on a pair of baggy shorts and a tee-shirt and shoes before heading to the front door. He was very uncertain what he was going to say, but it seemed as if fate was going to intervene. As he was stepping out the young girl was carrying a very big box in front of her and walking right up the path to his apartment door. She ran right into him not being able to see very well over the box and as she did eh grunted and took hold of the box before it fell. His hands brushed hers just slightly and the girl jumped almost dropping her side of the box.
    </p>
    <p>
    She looked around it at him light sky blue eyes looking up at him and Ryan said, "Hi!"
    </p>
    <p>
    The girl's eyes got wider and she said, "I'm sorry! I. . .I thought this was my apartment." Her cheeks filled with a blush.
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan shook his head, "nope see this is 1211, you must want 1212." He took the box gently and said, "Come on I'll walk you home."
    </p>
    <p>
    The girl giggled this time and said, "We're your new neighbors!"
    </p>
    <p>
    "I'd never have guessed." She giggled again and Ryan said, "I'm Ryan and you are?"
    </p>
    <p>
    "Celeste Appletree." Well at least there was a name to go with her cute little face. He walked with her into the house and as he sat the box down in the living room her mom came out from the bedroom and saw him as she saw him Celeste said, "This is Ryan mom he lives next door. . .I. . .I almost ran him over," Her face was filled with a blush as she said this. God she was a cute little darling.
    </p>
    <p>
    "Did you apologize?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan put his hand gently on Celeste's shoulder and said, "Your daughter was very polite Mrs. Appletree, she apologized for almost running me over immediately." The mom seemed satisfied and Ryan said, "If you don't mind I could help you two move in since it appears as if you don't have anyone else?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste's mom looked him over and then very politely said, "That would be very helpful indeed. I'm afraid all I could offer you in return would be a meal?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan smiled, "that would be fine." Mrs. Appletree, he put somewhere in her late thirties she was still young and very pretty. It was obviously that from her Celeste had inherited her light eyes, sandy blonde hair and fair skin. The woman was very small and petite probably from where her daughter had inherited her own skinny frame as well.
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan squeezed Celeste's shoulder again and said, "Come on little one lets go get some more boxes!"
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste looked up at him and said, "You know I'm not so little."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan bent down so that his green eyes were looking right into her large light blue and he said, "I'm six feet tall you're what? Four foot four or so?" She nodded and he said, "See your little!" Celeste started to look like she wanted to argue again with him and he said, "I like you though!"
    </p>
    <p>
    That was when a big smile broke out on the girls face and she said, "Just don't call me little one!"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan nodded and stood back up, "Okay then what should I call you shrimp?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Out of nowhere she kicked his shin and then giggled taking off out of the room. Ryan just shook his head and laughed before walking after her. She ran to the truck and as she was starting to climb back in to get another box Ryan walked up. She smiled at him as she picked up a box and she said, "Did I hurt you?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan rubbed his shin and said, "Not really, but why did you do that?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste shrugged her shoulders and said, "cause you called me a shrimp. I don't recall being a crustacean perhaps I was one in another life?" Goddamn she was smart, he thought to himself. She was a little witty too which he admired right away.
    </p>
    <p>
    She stepped up to the edge of the truck and looked like she was about to jump off so Ryan said, "here let me help you." At first she thought he was gong to take the box instead he put his hands on her waist and lifted her down to the ground. She had to weigh less than eighty pounds, the girl was tiny! She looked up at him and suddenly Ryan was overwhelmed with her beauty. He felt a real connection with this little girl, one that he couldn't explain. He ruffled the hair on the top of her head and said, "I'll make a deal with you, I won't call you little or a shrimp if you don't kick me in the shins."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste seemed to tilt her head and think about this for a moment. "Okay you have a deal big guy." Then giggled she headed off towards the house again. Ryan shook his head, it was amazing he decided how well this girl interacted with him. Then again most little girls felt instantly comfortable around him, as if they had known him for years when only meeting him seconds before. It took nearly another hour for them to finish unloading the truck and the entire time she kept calling him big guy and he kept calling her little one and she kept trying to hit him in the shin with her foot again. It was a fun game he had to admit.
    </p>
    <p>
    As he carried the last box in and sat it down on the floor Celeste fell on the couch and said, "We're done mom!"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan could smell something Italian cooking and as he collapsed on the couch next to Celeste the young girl looked up at him and he said, "What?" She crossed her eyes and stuck out her tongue and he chuckled, "you're face will stick like that if you do that too much."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste shook her eyes and then with her tongue still out she tried to talk saying, "mth fathe ith sthuch!" Ryan laughed again and reached out tickling one of her sides suddenly. Celeste started to giggle loudly as he tickled her. HE didn't stop until the little girl was lying on the couch and out of breath. He sat back his eyes roaming over her. She was so beautiful, that he felt his heart catch in his throat. It wasn't the outside he was seeing anymore. It was the inside too. Suddenly he realized something, he wanted to know this precious nine year old, and he wanted to know her for a very long time.
    </p>
    <p>
    They ate dinner at the small kitchen table and every time that he wanted something passed to him he said tings like, "could you pass the salt little one?" At one point when he said that she found his shin and he grunted and said, "Ow!"
    </p>
    <p>
    That was when Celeste's mom had said, "Are you okay Ryan?"
    </p>
    <p>
    He had smiled at Celeste and said, "Its nothing I just hit my shin on something."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste giggled and her mom said, "Well do be careful!" After eating Celeste's mom said, "Celeste sweetie go get a shower okay?" Celeste nodded and when she got up she looked at Ryan for a good few minutes and then took off towards the shower almost at a run. Ryan just shook his head and looked at where she ran to for just an instant. While Celeste showered Ryan helped her mom clear the table and that was when he got to learn more. Helen Appletree was a newly single mom. Her husband had left her and her daughter for a woman in her twenties. It had been too hard to keep the house that they had lived in so she had decided to sale it and move here temporarily (for one year) until she could find a new house. He learned that Helen was a business woman and that she worked very odd hours. After a while he began to understand. She was alone for the first time and struggling with her new life and trying to keep her daughter well adjusted.

    <p>
    As she loaded the dishwasher she said, "you know today is the first day in months I have seen Celeste happy. She smiled, she laughed, you must be a very special man indeed Mr. Sandleton."
    </p>
    <p>
    "Please its Ryan. Listen I know how hard it can be to be a single parent. My dad was one for most of my childhood. What do you plan to do in the afternoons with Celeste?"
    </p>
    <p>
    She sighed, "She was in after school daycare but that was all paid up before the divorce and its not something I can afford anymore." She sighed again and said, "I guess she was just going to have to be trusted to come home alone. . ."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan shuddered and shook his head, "no I'll watch her in the afternoons for you." Here he was being sincere while it would bring him closer to Celeste and let him have some more alone time with her it was also something he wanted to do. He wanted to help Celeste and her mom, help them get back on their feet. "I'll even pick her up from school so you don't have to worry about her at all."
    </p>
    <p>
    Helen looked up at him and said, "what about your job, won't that interfere with it?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan shook his head, "not at all I do most of my job from home. Anyway I want to help."
    </p>
    <p>
    Helen looked at him and just then Celeste came out from the back. Her hair was still wet but recently combed and looked darker because of the water still in it. She wore a very long night shirt that went to her knees and had that care bear with the heart in the middle of his chest on it. She looked form her mom to Ryan and said, "Mom can Ryan tuck me into bed?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Helen looked at Ryan and then at her daughter and she said, "I guess so." Celeste started to grab Ryan's hand but her mom said, "He'll be in in a minute okay?" Celeste nodded and then took off towards her bedroom. Helen looked at him and then at her daughter's bedroom. She seemed to think for a long while. Then quietly she said, "Just tell me Ryan that you will never hurt my daughter. . ."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan swallowed was his attraction to Celeste that obvious? "I could. . .I would never hurt Celeste."
    </p>
    <p>
    Helen looked at him for a long while and then said, "I'll let you know tomorrow where her elementary school is and what time it all ends and everything like that." Then in a very quiet voice she said, "She's going through a tough time right now Ryan, and she really needs someone that can understand her. Someone very much unlike her father." Ryan nodded and she said, "Go say goodnight to my daughter."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan walked down the hall to Celeste's room and looked in. Most everything was still packed up but she had opened one box and pulled out a small brown teddy bear. She sat on her bed Indian style and because of this Ryan got a perfect shot of little girl panties with little roses on them. Celeste saw him and smiled laying down on the bed suddenly. Her panties came into full view and Ryan couldn't help but look at them. They went right over the little camel toe showing it off perfectly. Celeste seemed to realize that her panties were showing. She blushed and quickly pulled her nightgown down and then slipped under the covers.
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan tucked the covers in and looked down into her very large sky blue eyes and said, "Looks like I'll be around more often little one."
    </p>
    <p>
    She blushed and said, "Stop calling me that big guy."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan kissed her forehead on instinct and said, "Only if you stop calling me that." She shook her head and without thought he stroked one of her cheeks before standing up and saying, "I have to go Celeste, but I'll see you tomorrow okay?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste nodded and as he started to leave she said, "Ryan?"
    </p>
    <p>
    He turned back, "Yeah?"
    </p>
    <p>
    "C. . .can you plug the dresser light in and turn it on I. . .I don't like the full dark!" Ryan nodded and plugged the light in and then started to close her door when she said, "Ryan!"
    </p>
    <p>
    HE came back into the room looking at her and said, "What now little one?"
    </p>
    <p>
    "Do you really like me? Or do you like my mom?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan walked back over to the bed sitting down on the edge of it he said, "Well it has to be a secret." She nodded and he said, "I like your mom. . .but well lets just say I like you a lot more."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste smiled big and her cheeks filled with a blush when she said, "I like you too Ryan. . .you're nice and funny!" Then she snuggled up with her teddy bear. Ryan looked at her for a few seconds. It was amazing how quickly a child could fall asleep. It was also amazing how quickly he could fall in love with a little girl. For that was exactly what had happened this day. He had fallen in love with Celeste. He stood up and left her door open a crack as he headed back out into the living room.
    </p>
    <p>
    Helen was sitting on the couch watching the news. When she saw him she smiled and said, "I don't know why I trust you with my little girl but I do." She paused looking at him and she said, "You aren't trying to get me interested in you are you?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan shook his head, "No Helen. Though I do hope that we can be friends."
    </p>
    <p>
    Helen smiled, "I do as well Ryan." She paused again and said, "You're just what she needs. Someone that will make her happy again. So if that's what she needs then I have to welcome you into her life, and into my own. Just be careful Ryan and always come to me if you have questions or need answers to something."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan nodded, "I will. Goodnight Helen I will see you tomorrow."
    </p>
    <p>
    "Goodnight Ryan." After he walked out the door she locked it. Back in his own apartment he undressed and went to his bedroom. His bedroom he realized rested along the same all that Celeste's bedroom did. He smiled remembering how soft she had been and how much fun she had been. He hadn't been around a little girl for such a long period ever in his life. Now suddenly he knew that this one was gong to be in it for a least a good year if not longer. He realized as he masturbated to his mental pictures of her that Celeste was his first little girl girlfriend. He just wondered how far all of this would go?

    </p>
    <p>
    The next morning Ryan didn't show up at the Appletree apartment until around eleven am. He wanted to make sure that both Celeste and her mom were awake and had completed whatever family things they needed to finish before he intruded on them. Actually he didn't show up at the Appletree apartment at all. He was about to head out the door of his own apartment when he opened it and found Celeste standing on his apartment porch her hand about to knock on the door. The nine year old girl jumped back slightly in surprise and then giggled when he smiled and said, "You a psychic kid or what?" Celeste was dressed today in a dark blue tee-shirt and a pair of shorts that looked like they might have been the ones from yesterday.
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste shook her head and said, "My mom sent me over to see if you were still going to come over today to talk to her about something grown up I imagine."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan smiled and said, "its something about you actually."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste got a look of sadness on her face as she said, "did I do something wrong?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan shook his head, "No way you didn't do anything wrong. Why do you think that you did?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste shrugged her shoulders, "maybe you don't like me?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan reached out squeezing one of her shoulders and said, "Why wouldn't I like you, you're smart, funny, and very pretty three qualities I happen to admired in girls."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste giggled at that but her cheeks also heated as she thought about this for a moment and then said, "Well okay if you really say so." She looked up at him her large sky blue eyes looking straight up as she said, "anyway my mom wants to talk to you."
    </p>
    <p>
    "DO you want to know why we are talking about you?" Celeste looked over at her apartment and then looked back up at Ryan. HE smiled and said, "Your mom is going to have me watch you after school until she gets home."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste thought about this for a second and then said, "Are you going to pick me up at school? Cause I hate riding the bus, you can ask my mom if you don't believe me!"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan chuckled, "Why wouldn't I believe you hmmm, have you ever lied to me before?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste shook her head and blushed as she said, "no, but grown ups don't always believe kids."
    </p>
    <p>
    She was right most grown ups didn't always believe kids. Well Ryan did. He leaned down a little closer and said, "I'll let you in on a little secret Celeste I'll always believe you when you tell me things okay?" She nodded and he said, "plus I don't like grown ups they are too grown up."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste screwed up her face making her nose scrunch up as she said, "but you're a grown up!"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan shook his head, "ahh I might be in body, but in spirit I'm not grown up at all. That's why I like being around you cause you let me be silly and have fun."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste turned her head sideways seeming to think about this for a moment then she said, "well you're fun too Ryan." God he loved how she didn't even bother with calling him by his last name. She grabbed his hand and said, "Come on my mom is waiting." At the door to her apartment she turned looking at him and in a very serious voice she said, "You'll always leave the light on right?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan smiled, "if you want it on and if I'm the one that has to put you to bed then yes it will be on. But one day I'd like to help you fight your fear Celeste if you'll let me." She didn't answer him she just looked at him for a second and seemed to file something away into the back of her mind before she opened the apartment door.
    </p>
    <p>
    Her mom was sifting through some of the living room boxes when they came in and she looked up at Ryan and Celeste and said, "It's about time. You didn't chat MR. Sandleton's ear off did you Celeste."
    </p>
    <p>
    The girl shook her head and said, "Nope Ryan's ear is still on the side of his face."
    </p>
    <p>
    She was standing right in front of him and Ryan reached down and dug a couple of fingers into one of her sides making her giggle loudly as he said, "The little one wasn't any trouble at all. In fact I so rarely get to talk to anyone that she's quite a joy, and she has a very quick mind." He stopped tickling her and Celeste looked up at him as if she was truly seeing things in a different light. Perhaps yesterday she had sensed that he was different than most adult men but now she was perhaps sensing that he was different than most adults. He had yet to actually talk "at" Celeste he only talked to her as if she was a person of great value to him. Which she was quickly becoming.
    </p>
    <p>
    Helen just shrugged it off and stood up pulling out a small notebook from the box she had been digging in and she said, "I have decided to let you take care of Celeste after school. I thought about it heavily last night and it will help a lot with expenses. That is its okay if my daughter thinks its okay?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste looked up at Ryan and said, "Oh its okay mom I like Ryan he's nice."
    </p>
    <p>
    Her mom nodded and said, "Celeste attends Miller Elementary School by any chance do you know where that is?" Ryan shook his head and Helen nodded. She took a piece of paper and drew the instructions on how to get to Miller Elementary. Celeste looked the paper over and nodded in agreement that it was right and Ryan pocketed it to look it over again when he got home. "I will usually be home around six, but on some occasions it will be later than that, I don't work weekends but for once a month. I have to work one Saturday a month as part of a monthly inventory process."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan nodded, "Its not a problem Helen not at all. I can take care of Celeste as much as you need to as long as its okay that on occasion she goes with me on some of my runs for my job?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Helen thought for a moment and said, "Any day that you need to make a run let me know and we will handle it by a day by day process. Though I don't ever see it being a problem as long as Celeste doesn't."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan looked down at Celeste who was still standing with her back resting partly against his stomach. It felt nice having her so close to him. Celeste looked up at him and at her mom and said, "It sounds okay to me as long as it's not boring!"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan reached down and made his hand into the shape of a claw and dug into her middle section making the little nine year old giggle loudly. He tickled her until she couldn't stand and she was on the floor trying to roll away from him. Finally he stopped and took her hand helping her back up as he did Helen said, "shall we get to work we do have a whole apartment to unpack." It was a long process unpacking all of the rooms. The three of them started with the kitchen, dinning room, and living area. It took all afternoon and by the time that they were finished and after they had eaten pizza Helen announced that she was tuckered out.
    </p>
    <p>
    She fell down onto the couch as she said this. Celeste had wanted to sit on Ryan's lap when they were eating and she was still there though she was getting a little heavy. He decided right then and there while she was a light nine year old girl that didn't mean that she was a baby anymore. Celeste looked up at him as her mom said, "that's it for me today."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste was perhaps gauging how tired Ryan was as she did he stroked one of her legs. He wasn't sure how his hand had landed on her leg but it was there anyway softly rubbing such soft and warm skin. Celeste gauged him for a few minutes before saying, "There's a park across the road. . .can I. . .would you watch me while I swing?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan looked over at Helen and she just nodded her head. He gently squeezed Celeste's leg and said, "If you want to go swinging then that's what we'll do." Celeste slipped off of his leg grabbing her cup of soda and took one last long gulp of it. He could see all of her very slender neck as she took her drink and then she took his hand dragging him out of the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan felt hopelessly lost by this point. It wasn't that she was making him follow her like a lost little puppy it was more that he would have willingly gone with her anywhere she wanted to go. They crossed the street and headed to the park. Ryan said, "Why don't I push you on the swing?" Celeste looked up at the darkening sky and then at him and he said, "don't worry about it I'll be here with you no one is going to get us I promise."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste thought about this for a moment and then said, "Okay you can push me then." SHE climbed up onto the swing and he took it pulling it back. He did wonder as he pushed her, his hands touching her warm back each time she came back, why she was so afraid of the dark. Was it a childhood phobia or had something really bad happened in the dark? She didn't have any of the signs of a girl abused and he had a feeling that her mom wouldn't let her near a strange man if she had been abused. Perhaps when he got to know Celeste a little bit better he would ask her why she was so afraid of the dark.
    </p>
    <p>
    She was getting really high now and he was pushing her by touching the back side of her bottom. She giggled when she got really high and then she said, "I want to jump off now."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan said, "Okay just be careful, after all this is my first night out with you. Your mom might not look too kindly on me if I bring you back broken."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste waited until her swinging had gone down a little and then she took hold of the swing and jumped landing on the grass before the swings perfectly. From where he stood behind her Ryan admired her very small and perfectly round bottom. Then she turned around looked at him and giggled as she said, "see perfect jump!"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan chuckled "I give it a twelve."
    </p>
    <p>
    She shook her head and said, "You can't give it a twelve it's a ten point scaling system!"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan walked over to where she was and said, "I can pick you up, and I can tickle you little one. . .I think I can also grade a twelve even on a ten point scale!" A little bubble of giggles escaped from her and she tried to get away from him but he grabbed her pulling her close and he lifted her shirt without warning and blew a raspberry on her stomach. Celeste's giggles filled his ears and Ryan finally let her go.
    </p>
    <p>
    As he did she looked down at her wet stomach with its little outward belly button and said, "That was disgusting! You got my tummy all wet!"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan smiled and said, "It was such a cute tummy I jus thought I would try to eat it!"
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste giggled, "You can't eat my tummy its my tummy!"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan pulled her closer to him and with his hands on her shoulders he said, "Yea its your tummy but its still a cute tummy."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste's cheeks filled and her sky blue eyes met his and the nine year old leaned over suddenly and pecked his lips once lightly as she did she said, "yea and now you belong to me!" He was swimming in her light blue eyes and right then and there Ryan decided that yeah he did belong to Celeste. He had never imagined he would meet such a wonderful and fun little girl, yet here she was.
    </p>
    <p>
    He stood up slowly suddenly starting to get uncomfortable in his pants. While he knew deep inside of himself that Celeste turned him on and that being with her sexually would make him stand fully erect, just being around her seemed to have a very calming effect and he didn't even think about having sex with her. He was just enjoying the time he spent with this special girl. If a relationship developed between them it would be on her grounds not his own. She would lead them where she wanted them to go, he would not force her into anything or even manipulate her.
    </p>
    <p>
    They started back towards the apartment and Celeste put her hand in his wrapping her fingers with his own as she did she said, "This is how boyfriends and girlfriends hold hands that's what Sally told me."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan smiled, "Sally is a smart girl."
    </p>
    <p>
    "Yup!"
    </p>
    <p>
    "But not as smart as you little one."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste giggled, "Thanks big guy!" She looked up at him as they finished crossing the street and then said, "So can I be your girlfriend Ryan or am I too young?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan felt his heart miss a beat. He smiled at Celeste and said, "I think it's a safe bet that you can be my girlfriend."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste's cheeks filled with a blush and she said, "Oh really!!?"
    </p>
    <p>
    "Yes really."
    </p>
    <p>
    She looked down at the ground in front of them and then said, "So that means you'll tuck me in again? And you'll leave the dresser light on?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan stopped before the gate that led back to their part of the apartments and bent down until he was even with Celeste. He put his hands on her waist and this slight intimate contact seemed to make her more aware of him. HE smiled and said, "I'll tuck you in as many nights as you want me to and your mom lets me. I will always leave the dresser light on as well." She nodded and he took one hand running it through her sandy blonde hair pushing it back behind one of her ears. Her face heated as he did this and he said, "you are very beautiful, and don't ever forget it okay? And if you need me to I'll protect you from the dark."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste suddenly leaned over and hugged him almost throwing his balance off. Ryan hugged her back running one hand over her small bottom holding her there and on her back. She looked at him for a long while her eyes just holding his then she took his hand again and he knew that meant he should stand again. Back at her apartment Celeste went to the bathroom and he heard the shower start. He helped Helen put the left over pizza away and as he did she said, "She can't sleep in pitch darkness. Not since she was six."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan looked up at Helen and said, "Everyone has a few phobias in life."
    </p>
    <p>
    Helen sighed, "Its one I'd like to see her outgrow. I would tell you about where it comes from but I think its more her place than mine." She looked at Ryan and said, "I don't want to trust you with Celeste, but when I see how the two of you are together. . lets just say that I want to hope again."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan looked at the door to the bathroom and said, "You don't have to worry about me with your daughter Helen. I adore Celeste and could never hurt her. I know that I've only known her for a little over twenty-four hours but. . .I can't explain it, its like I've known her a lot longer."
    </p>
    <p>
    The shower stopped and Helen said, "She is a special girl, there is no doubt about that." Celeste came out a few seconds later dressed again in her nightgown from the night before. Her sandy blonde hair was combed neatly and when she walked into the front of the apartment she walked right over to Ryan and took his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
    "Its time for me to go to bed." Ryan nodded and followed Celeste to her bedroom. The girl didn't seem to argue about bedtime. She climbed up into her bed and got under the covers giving the briefest shot of white panties and she grabbed her teddy bear and as Ryan turned the dresser light on and then turned the overhead light off Celeste said, "You don't have an older girlfriend do you?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan sat down on the edge of the bed as she said this and he softly rubbed one of her cheeks. How he knew that she would accept this intimacy he wasn't sure, but he knew right away that she expected it from him. "You're the only one I have Celeste."
    </p>
    <p>
    She nodded seemingly satisfied and he started to stand again when she grabbed at his hand and said, "Boyfriends usually give their girlfriends goodnight kisses." Ryan smiled leaned down and kissed her forehead once. She shook her head, "no silly on the lips!" Ryan swallowed once and then leaned down and lightly pecked her lips. Celeste nodded in satisfaction and as he stood again she said in a sleepy voice, "goodnight Ry," big huge yawn as she snuggled closer to her teddy bear and closed her eyes. She finished his name in a mumbled, "anmmmmf." And she as out just like that. Ryan watched her for another minute before leaving her room. He left the door partly open.
    </p>
    <p>
    Helen was sitting on the couch watching the news quietly and as Ryan headed towards the front door she said, "If my daughter ever expresses her want or desire for something from you Mr. Sandleton please come to me. Don't just assume anything. And don't just jump into anything."
    </p>
    <p>
    At the door Ryan turned back to look at the amazing Helen Appletree who probably knew exactly what he was and he said, "I would never do anything to cause either you or Celeste any harm Helen."
    </p>
    <p>
    "That's what I wanted to know. Have a goodnight Ryan and I will see you tomorrow when I get home from work." Ahh that was right tomorrow was the first day that he was going to be picking Celeste up from school. That night as Ryan laid in his bed he couldn't stop thinking about tomorrow and he wondered what Celeste would want to do! Well he would find out, tomorrow would begin an all new adventure in his life!

    <p>
    Ryan hadn't ever been to Cynthia Ann Miller Elementary but now that he had he had to admit that he was impressed. The school was not huge but it was a lot bigger than his own elementary had been. It was three in the afternoon now and all the kids were filing out. Ryan had never had an excuse before today to go to an elementary school to watch the kids file out of the school. Now he had a third grade reason to go and he found that amazing. He had a girlfriend and she was in the third grade. For some reason that thought made him harden.
    </p>
    <p>
    There was a difference in size between the grades. Even in the same grades. Some fifth grade girls were even starting to develop little bumps. His eyes kept going everywhere. He was looking at all of these cute little girls, but he was really looking and waiting for Celeste to show herself. Then there she was. Out of this sea of girls she was the most beautiful to him. There was just something about her. She wore a purplish-blue shirt that had the words: What Are You Looking At written on the front of it. Ryan found it adorable. She also wore shorts that stopped at about the middle of her thighs and that were the same color. He could see the button in the middle. Ryan tried not to stare at Celeste too hard but he couldn't help it. When he saw his little girlfriend it was like the rest of the girls all disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
    She was talking to another girl, with very light blonde hair and dark green eyes. As she was talking to this girl another smaller girl ran up to them. This girl had the same light blonde hair as the first and he figured that they must have been sisters. Celeste said something to the younger girl and then looked over at his car and said something else to the older girl who walked over with her. Ryan felt slightly nervous and he wasn't sure why. Still he rolled down the window and unlocked the door. Celeste opened the door and said, "Ryan this is Amanda she's my best friend."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan smiled and said, "Nice to meet you Amanda."
    </p>
    <p>
    Amanda blushed and Ryan could see how pretty she was now that she was closer. Amanda wore a light white dress that seemed to hug to her very flat chest. As she blushed and as he took her in Amanda said, "Hi."
    </p>
    <p>
    Then Celeste said, "And this is her little sister Wendy."
    </p>
    <p>
    "Hi Wendy nice to meet you too." The younger girl just giggled and then her older sister said something to Celeste before the two girls walked hand in hand down the line of cars to their own mom's. Celeste climbed into the front passenger seat and buckled her seatbelt and as she leaned over to buckle it Ryan caught a scent of her shampoo. Despite how busy of a day it must have been her hair still had that clean smell to it.
    </p>
    <p>
    He turned towards the road and followed another car out of the school parking lot. As he was turning out of the parking lot Celeste said, "Amanda wanted to meet you."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan smiled, "Not a problem. So how was school?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste looked over at him and said, "It was about the same as always. But at lunch today Nathan Willers kissed Stacy Primers. He's eleven and she's only eight!" She giggled a little as she said, "one of the teachers came by and I think that he saw it but he didn't say anything about it. It wasn't like it was a long kiss or anything cause it wasn't. But now everyone says they are dating and neither one of them cares." She looked at Ryan and he briefly glanced at her before turning back to the road as she sad, "I wish you went to my school. Math class was boring so I kept thinking about what you might have been doing. So. . what were you doing?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan turned down another street on the way home and said, "Would you believe that I was anxiously waiting till three o'clock so I could come pick you up?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste giggled, "You don't work?"
    </p>
    <p>
    "Well I did do some of that too. So what do you want to do this afternoon little one?"
    </p>
    <p>
    "Well usually after I get off of school, back when I went to daycare, I would sit down at a table somewhere and do my homework. Then usually I'd play with the other kids that are there or watch television. My mom's one rule is that I have to finish my homework first."
    </p>
    <p>
    "Okay then you do your homework and I will finish up the last of my work work!" Celeste giggled again but nodded. He parked the car in the apartment parking lot and walked up to his apartment. Celeste hadn't actually been in his apartment yet. He opened the door and let her in and as she dropped her book bag down on his couch he watched her walk around his apartment. This was the third day he had seen Celeste and it was also the third day he had seen her wearing very tight shorts. The bottom bands around her legs did not close all the way again! He wondered if she sat down right would he be able to see her panties? The shorts just looked really loose on her, but they sure were tight around her very well formed little bottom!
    </p>
    <p>
    He had a bookshelf full of books and when her eyes roamed over the books she said, "You have Harry Potter?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan smiled, "Of course I do, they are very good books."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste nodded and said, "Everyone says I kinda look like Hermione in the face."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan looked at her face a little closer and said, "I can see why they would say that, but I think you're prettier than she is."
    </p>
    <p>
    He was rewarded with a blush before Celeste went back to looking around the room. She walked over to his bedroom door and he didn't stop her from going in. He knew how important it was for Celeste to feel like she was at home. He wanted his apartment to be like a second home to her. He followed her into the bedroom and she looked at his computer as she looked it over she said, "What kind of computer is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan chuckled, "the kind that turns on and off."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste rolled her eyes at him and said, "I know that I'm not stoopid!" He loved the way that she used the word stupid.
    </p>
    <p>
    "Its top of the line everything. I'm not a huge computer guy all I know is what I was told when I purchased it a few months back. Its all top of the line and it took hours for me to transfer my work files from one computer to another." Not to mention his pictures of little girls and stories as well. He didn't tell Celeste that though. She bumped his mouse and his screen saver went off. There on his desktop was still that picture of a cute little girl holding a flower.
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste didn't even seem bothered by it or even ask questions about it. She just continued walking around his room and then headed back out and as she passed him in the doorway she said, "So now its homework time!"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan followed her back into the living room. This was one strange and beautiful little girl. He couldn't help but feel overwhelmed with her around him. She was intoxicating and he wanted to spend forever with her. Yet he knew for a girl her age forever was a very long time. He also knew not to press anything onto her, let her discover things at her own pace, with her own desires intact. He walked into the kitchen and said, "Do you want a soda to drink?"
    </p>
    <p>
    "Sure what do you have?"
    </p>
    <p>
    "Dr. Pepper, or Pepsi."
    </p>
    <p>
    "Dr. Pepper!" Ahh my kind of girl, he thought to himself before he handed her one of the sodas.
    </p>
    <p>
    She popped the can and he watched her take a sip before he said, "I will be in my office which is the other room, the one you didn't go in." Celeste nodded and he walked into his office. He had two computers, one in his bedroom and one in here. The one in here and the one in his bedroom both had the same work files on them so he could work from either one. About twenty minutes into his work he had to make a phone call. He was on the phone for nearly another twenty minutes when Celeste walked in as hew as saying, "I don't care Kevin just find a way to get it done."
    </p>
    <p>
    He smiled at Celeste to show her it was okay for her to come in. She surprised him by coming to stand in front of him. As Kevin said something inane to him on the other end he reached out and ran a hand over Celeste's stomach tickling her a little bit. She giggled and smiled before climbing up onto his lap and resting facing him. She sat with her legs spread on either side of his own, pushing her shorts up against her crotch and he couldn't help but stare a little bit as she leaned in more and put her head on his chest. She felt so soft there on his lap like this and Ryan wasn't sure at all what she needed.
    </p>
    <p>
    He gently rubbed her back with one hand while his other held the phone and he said, "Just get it done okay Kevin? Good, talk to you later." Then he hung up the phone and sighed heavily. He sat back in his chair and Celeste looked up at him. The third grade girl had a really intense look in her eyes as she looked up at him. Ryan wasn't sure at all what she was thinking but he softly rubbed one of her cheeks with his fingers tracing it and she leaned in again suddenly just resting her head against his chest. He held her rubbing her back and for a little while they stayed like that.
    </p>
    <p>
    Then Celeste slipped off of his lap and said, "Soooo do you have Cartoon Network?" Ryan chuckled and took her hand leading her back to the living room. He turned the television on and flicked it to the cartoon network then he sat down on the couch beside her. Celeste snuggled up close to him for awhile but about two cartoons in he had to get up and go get a phone call. He had just finished the phone call when he came out of the study. She was laying on the couch now long ways on her back. One of her legs rested against the head rest of the couch and the other one was spread out. This had made the loose legs of her shorts open up and Ryan could see her panties. They were light blue with little hearts decorated all over them. Ryan stared for perhaps a second too long.
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste's eyes looked up at him and she looked back down at herself and then quickly sat up. She blushed deeply and said, "Sorry."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan swallowed and sat down beside her again as he said, "sorry for what?"
    </p>
    <p>
    "I dunno."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan put his arm around her shoulders and again he was amazed at how it seemed to fit there and he said, "You are very pretty and sometimes I guess I can't help but look."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste's cheeks filled to the brim with a blush and she said, "I don't guess you would want to be my boyfriend if you didn't think I was pretty."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan rubbed her shoulder and said, "Does Amanda know that I'm your boyfriend?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste shook her head, "no I thought about telling her but then I thought about all the trouble you could get into and decided that I'd wait till I was sure she wouldn't go blabbing it to her mom or something stupid like that."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan swallowed, "how much trouble I could get in?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste nodded, "yeah I know that other people would probably think it was weird cause you're so much older than me. Is it weird Ryan?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan squeezed her shoulder, "do you think that it is weird Celeste?"
    </p>
    <p>
    She thought about it for a long time and said, "I'd rather have you for a boyfriend than someone like Nathan Willers." Ryan felt a wave of warmth wash over him as he stroked his little girlfriends arm and she said suddenly, "did you think that Amanda was pretty? I mean she's always got such pretty clothes. . ."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan chuckled, "Yes Amanda was pretty."
    </p>
    <p>
    "Do you think that she would make a better girlfriend than me cause of that?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan squeezed her shoulder again, "There is no girl that could be better than you okay little one?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste smiled and blushed a little before putting her head against him again. They silently watched cartoons together and Ryan couldn't get over how amazing this was. He had dreamed of having a little girl trust him this much, but he had never thought it would actually be possible. She was beautiful, she was smart, and she was very capable of handling herself. He had heard people say that nine year olds were incapable of making decisions well it sure seemed to him as if they were capable. Celeste knew what she wanted. Right now she wanted to be held against his side. Ryan couldn't think of anything better than having her there just holding her and being this close with her.
    </p>
    <p>
    Helen got home shortly after that and as she walked back over to her apartment telling Celeste that dinner would be ready soon Celeste looked up at him then leaned over and hugged him deeply. Ryan hugged her back and Celeste said, "I'll see you tomorrow right?" Ryan nodded and she said, "I would ask you to come tuck me in tonight but my mom might start to really think it was strange. . .I. . .I mean I don't really need anyone to tuck me in anymore. Plus we need some time just the two of us. . . uhh.. ." She hugged him again and when she broke off she said, "You really really like me Ryan?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan bent down and lightly kissed her nose, "I really really like you Celeste."
    </p>
    <p>
    She blushed and leaned over and kissed him right on the lips. It was a two second peck but it was still the nicest thing he had gotten all day. Then she said, "Am I going to have to tell you everyday that you kiss your girlfriend on the lips?" Ryan stared helplessly after her as she walked out of his apartment. She was so small, so tiny, and so beautiful. He knew it then as he closed his apartment door he was totally and helplessly in love with a nine year old girl. Not just any nine year old, no this was Celeste Appletree a breed all of her own.

    </p>
    <p>
    The next month seemed to slip by easily. It wasn't something that Ryan could have described without saying that it was almost all common place. He spent most of his afternoons with Celeste and he found a common ground between the two of them. There were a lot of things that she shared with him that Ryan just found fully amazing. It wasn't like they had a lot in common, there was a whole generation bridging between the two of them. Yet at the same time there was much about Celeste that he admired and loved. It was hard to determine what kind of relationship they had, for he knew that even though she was a smart nine year old girl she saw things differently than he did.
    </p>
    <p>
    Which was how it was supposed to be. A lot of his friends online talked with him about it. Those that had already had girlfriends Celeste's age. They told him to expect a lot, but not to expect everything. As he had to explain many times to them it wasn't anything sexual. Oh he desired Celeste sexually, he would have touched her and explored her intimately if she asked him to, but he did not expect it. All he really wanted from Celeste was what he got. That was to explore her mind and see the world the way that she saw it. He loved the girl deeply, there was no denying that, but he also knew that for her things were very different than they were for him.
    </p>
    <p>
    It was a Friday morning and he was just starting to work on a few things when there was a knock at his door. Ryan hadn't been expecting anyone so he figured that it had to be a telemarketer or some one selling something. He walked up to the door and looked out the peephole surprised to see Helen standing there. He opened the door and said, "good morning," Then he looked down at his watch and said, "Shouldn't you already be at work?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Helen smiled, "I'm heading there right now. In fact that's the reason why I came over. Celeste is sick, she's running a temperature and she's been throwing up. I was wondering if you could check on her, maybe watch her make sure that she's got what she needs."
    </p>
    <p>
    Instantly Ryan's heart missed a beat and he felt this great need to be there for Celeste. His little girl was sick and he knew that he would be good at taking care of her. "Its not a problem at all Helen I will make sure that Celeste is well taken care of." Helen nodded relieved and then headed off to work. Ryan finished the last part of his work and closed his computer down before heading over to Celeste's apartment. He had been given a spare key just incase something happened and they needed the key. Or incase Celeste needed something and her mom wasn't home yet. It was a good idea and Ryan knew that it was Celeste's mom putting a lot of trust in him that had gotten him this key.
    </p>
    <p>
    He walked into the apartment and headed to Celeste's door. He knocked on the door once and she said, "Come in." His heart swelled with his need to take care of Celeste when he saw her. His beautiful little girlfriend was sick there was no doubt about that. Her eyes were puffy, her nose red and stuffed up. There were some tissue papers on the floor and Ryan bent down to pick them up tossing them into the trash can that she had missed. She was still wearing her light blue colored nightgown.
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan walked over to where she was sitting down on the bed beside her and he said, "how you feeling?"
    </p>
    <p>
    She shook her head, "not too good." She sniffed a little bit and Ryan felt her forehead with his hand. She laid back down on the bed her blue eyes looking at him and she said, "I threw up three times last night I hate throwing up!"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan sighed as he stroked one of her cheeks and said, "Are you hungry?" Celeste nodded and he said, "how about I make you some chicken noodle soup I bet you could keep that down."
    </p>
    <p>
    She thought about it for a minute and said, "Okay but I think we only have chicken and stars."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan smiled, "not to worry little one I have some in my apartment. I'll be right back okay?" He squeezed one of Celeste's hands in his. He stood up and left the room. When he came back with the soup he put it in the microwave and walked back into her bedroom. Celeste was still lying on her bed looking miserable. He sat down beside her again resting a hand on her cheek feeling the warmth of it as he said, "you know what else will make you feel better?" Celeste shook her head, "cartoons."
    </p>
    <p>
    "But I don't have a TV in my room."
    </p>
    <p>
    "I know that's why I was thinking we should move to the living room." Celeste looked uncertain but Ryan didn't take her uncertainty to heart this time. He gathered her bedspread around her and picked that up along with Celeste and carried her into the living room. He gently laid the nine year old down on the couch and flipped the television on. It only took him a second to find the cartoons and then he went and got her soup.
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste coughed a few times, body racking coughs that he couldn't believe were coming out of such a sweet sounding little girl. He put the soup down on a tray and brought that out to the living room along with a big glass of water. Celeste looked at the food and got a very tired look on her face. Ryan smiled and said, "Here sit up against me okay." He moved so that she could sit up with her back against his side and her head resting on the top of his shoulder. She put her feet up making her knees a stand of some sort for the tray to sit on. She ate slowly and Ryan watched her at first. Eventually though she started eating a little bit more of the soup and she was really starting to enjoy the cartoon.
    </p>
    <p>
    After she at and drank most of the water she moved on the couch again putting her pillow down on his lap and she laid her head down on the pillow facing towards the television. Ryan did no tell her no. He was softly stroking her sandy blonde hair as she watched the television and eh could tell that she was drifting off into sleep. Neither one of them said anything, they just stayed there together watching the television. Suddenly just as he was certain she was starting to drift off Celeste jumped up and ran to the bathroom. He heard her throwing up, a very un-little girl like sound but he knew that it came with the territory of loving a little girl. She came back out a few minutes later looking more miserable again and said, "I hate being sick."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan smiled and said, "I know sweetie. Why don't you lay down with your head over here," He put the pillow down on the other side of the couch and he said, "I'll try to help make you feel better." She didn't ask him how she just did as he instructed. Ryan moved the blankets back until he could see her feet and he softly picked one up and began to rub it. At first Celeste looked right at him as if studying him but then she just slowly started to drift off into sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
    As he massaged her small feet Ryan couldn't help but look at Celeste. She was so beautiful. It was impossible that this little girl really liked him. It just didn't seem like reality. He had always treated little girls as if they were special. . .but this one to him really was. She was more special than anything else in the world to him. More valuable than any precious metal. Gently he put her other foot down and Celeste moved a little bit on the couch. He realized something as he looked at her, he was in love. There was no doubt about it. He wasn't stupid he knew what love was. He knew what it meant to be in love.
    </p>
    <p>
    He had desired little girls before, even wanted quite a few that he had pictures of sexually, but all of that was superficial. Did he want to sleep with Celeste? Absolutely. Did she turn him on? Oh god did she ever! But it wasn't about that. Not at all. Every moment he spent with Celeste was like another moment that he got to spend that much closer to heaven. He was about to take her feet off of his lap when Celeste opened her eyes partly and said, "Ryan?"
    </p>
    <p>
    His eyes met hers and he said, "Yeah sweetheart?"
    </p>
    <p>
    "W. . .would you hold me for awhile?" He leaned over her gently picking her up in his arms and he helped her rest against him. She was still wearing just his night gown but as she sat on his lap facing him resting her crotch right against his own and her head against his he couldn't help but marvel at her beauty. He started to harden as he felt her legs rub along his own and he moved laying them down on the couch. She was laying on top of him on the couch one of her legs hanging down off the side of the couch the other one laying against one of his own. She smiled up at him before laying her head down on his chest. Ryan could feel her crotch against his own and he couldn't help but respond. He tried not to, but. . .she was so beautiful, so trusting, so his.
    </p>
    <p>
    He pulled the blanket over them resting it at right about the middle of her back and he fluffed up one of the couch cushions resting it against this back. Celeste looked at him and he smiled taking her pillow and giving it to her. She put it on his chest and laid her head down on the pillow. Ryan gently rested a hand on her back under the covers and softly stroked her back. He could feel the warmth of her little girl body pressed against this own. He was very uncomfortable in his pants but it was okay because he knew that Celeste was the reason for it. She didn't even seem to be bothered by his discomfort.
    </p>
    <p>
    He could tell by her even breathing, which he could feel against his stomach and his hand on her back that the little girl was sound asleep snuggled on top of him within minutes. Ryan drifted off into sleep eventually as well and when he woke up it was to the feeling that someone was watching him. He turned his head sideways and his eyes met Helen. She smiled looking at both of them and with a finger to her lips softly mouthed the words, "thank you."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan only smiled and stroked Celeste's back again. The girl's pillow had fallen to the floor at some point and her head now rested directly on his chest. Helen headed towards her bedroom in the back of the apartment and Ryan softly ran a hand through Celeste's hair debating on if he should get up or not. He felt her forehead and was relieved to realize that the girls fever had broken. Besides those brief few moments when she had first lain on top of him Ryan had only had thoughts in his head of taking care of Celeste not any of being with her in a sexual way.
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste coughed suddenly and moved her head and her body one of her knees landing right in his crotch for a second before it dropped down between him and the couch cushions. She opened her eyes slowly as she sat up. The pattern of his wrinkled shit had imbedded itself in one of her cheeks, which made her look all the more adorable. She coughed again and Ryan said, "Hi."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste's cheeks heated and she sat up more slipping off of him and said, "I. . .I'm sorry Ryan."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan sat up as well so that now his legs were on either side of her with her sitting on her knees. She coughed again as he said, "what are you sorry about sweetie?"
    </p>
    <p>
    "That I fell asleep for so long."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan chuckled, "Its okay really."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste shook her head, "no I'm sure you had work to do."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan took one of her small hands in his and kissed her knuckles lightly as he said, "I do but it can always wait. You're mom said you were sick and I figured you really needed someone to take care of you so I did. What's wrong with that?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste's cheeks filled with a blush, "nothing I guess I just...I mean I just thought you had work to do."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan looked her in the eyes and said, "Are you trying to get rid of me?" Celeste shook her head and he said, "Good cause there is no way that you are going to get rid of me." She giggled slightly at that which became a cough. When the cough ended he softly stroked her back and said, "You okay?" Celeste nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
    Then her mom came out of her own bedroom and said, "Are you hungry Celeste?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste looked at Ryan and then at her mom and said, "yeah actually I am." The girl got chicken and stars this time. Which she managed to keep down. After she finished eating she wrapped herself in her blankets and went to brush her teeth. When she came out of the bathroom she said, "W. ..would you stay with me till I fall asleep again Ryan?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan looked at her mom and he could see it in Helen's eyes the thought of: god my little girl's got a crush on a man more than twice her age. Yet he could also see within those same eyes how much Helen cared for her daughter. He knew that by now she was well aware of how much he cared for Celeste as well. "Sure I will little one." He walked with Celeste into her room and the nine year old climbed into her bed still wrapped in her blankets. He sat down on the edge of the bed and said, "Is there something in particular you wanted me to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste nodded, "would you. . .you know. . .rub my back again like you were doing earlier." Ryan obliged the little angel. He didn't apply a lot of pressure to her back he applied just enough to make it feel good. Celeste was relaxing towards sleep when she gave a large sigh and moved on the bed. It was almost like she was rubbing against her bed. Then the nine year old girl stopped and slowly sat up. She sat up until she was eye level with him. It was impossible to break eye contact with her. The young nine year old studied his face and then said, "I really do like you Ryan." Then she leaned over and shocked the hell out of him by kissing him on the lips.
    </p>
    <p>
    This time it wasn't a little two second peck this one lasted a lot longer. Finally she pulled back and he swallowed as she laid back down on her back this time. She snuggled with her teddy bear and Ryan softly stroked one of her cheeks as he said, "What was that for sweetie?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste blushed a little, "no reason just wanted to show you that I know you care about me." Ryan leaned down and lightly hugged her resting his face in her hair a minute smelling the shampoo of then he let her go. She snuggled into her bed with her teddy bear. Ryan turned off the big overhead light but he left the small dresser light on. Celeste seemed satisfied. He softly kissed her forehead, her fever had fully broken, and left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
    Helen was sitting on the couch watching something on the television. She looked at him and said, "you'll need to watch Celeste tomorrow too if its not a problem?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan nodded, "Its not a problem at all." He stopped in his turn to the front door and turned back to Helen. He sat down in the extra chair next to the couch and said, "I just want you to know something Helen. I love your daughter. She's that single little bright point of my day. I would never do anything to hurt her or force anything on her."
    </p>
    <p>
    Helen looked at him for a long time almost five minutes before saying, "she's special to you, but not special like how she is to me. You don't see her as a daughter, what exactly do you see her as Ryan?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan swallowed, "a girl that I love very much Mrs. Appletree."
    </p>
    <p>
    Again silence then, "When I was Celeste's age there was this older boy, about six or so years younger than you, but still a lot older than me. I was infatuated with him. He would talk with me and other girls around me too sometimes. This was the seventies and things were different but not that different. You remind me of him in some ways, but differently as well. My daughter needs you. I think sometimes that all little girls should have a man like you in their lives. Someone who sees them as other than a bothersome kid. Someone who sees that my little girl for the special and wonderful person that she is." She paused putting a finger to her forehead and said, "She may not be fully grown up here, but I've always refused to believe that here," she pointed at her heart, "isn't fully grown. She has great capacity to love. . .and she's chosen to love you."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan swallowed and said, "I won't break her heart, there might come a time when she breaks mine. . ."
    </p>
    <p>
    Helen smiled, "you're in a lot better position to pick up broken pieces than she is. Be here for her Ryan for as long as she needs you to be here for her. Reassure me that you won't turn your back on my daughter just because she starts to grow up."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan smiled, "Celeste will always be the same special girl she is right now. I will never stop loving your daughter. That love might change but I will never stop it from ending."
    </p>
    <p>
    Helen nodded and flipped her television off as she said, "goodnight Ryan, and don't forget to be over here early in the morning so you can watch Celeste all day long."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan stood and said, "I won't forget." Back at his own house as he undressed he realized something. Celeste's mom knew. She knew that her little girl turned him on. She knew that his love was not a parental kind. She knew and yet she hadn't branded him or thrown him out of her house. She also knew that he would never initiate sexual contact with her daughter. That while he loved Celeste and saw it as a real relationship between the two of them he would never force himself on her daughter. He also knew that if Celeste ever expressed an interest to move things forward he would have to go to her mom and talk with her about that as well, and that would mean Celeste talking to her mom as well. Because Celeste would have to prove that she wanted it and not that he was forcing it upon her. . .God he had never realized how complex loving a little girl could be! Yet how rewarding as well!

    </p>
    <p>
    The knock on the door made Ryan jerk up from his bed. He groaned as he realized that he had forgotten to set his alarm clock. He quickly pulled on a pair of shorts and walked to the door opening it. Celeste was standing there with a big grin on her face and Ryan just groaned and turned heading back inside. She followed him and closed the door. She didn't even comment that he had on no shirt. He sneezed and then realized that he had set the alarm and then hit it turning it off after he came back from the bathroom and threw up. He knew it now as he collapsed down on his bed, he was sick. He looked at Celeste as she stood in his doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
    The young nine year old was dressed so beautifully today. She had been anticipating a day out Ryan was certain. She wore a dark blue shirt with no sleeves and he could see part of her stomach where the shirt ended. If she lifted her hands up the shirt would pull up and reveal her stomach up to about the belly button. A cute shirt, that made her look sexy especially along with the short dark blue skirt she was wearing that stopped at the middle of her thighs. Such long and beautiful legs his girlfriend had Ryan couldn't help but look for a few seconds as she walked over to where he was.
    </p>
    <p>
    She immediately reached out and touched his forehead and said, "You've got a fever." Then she stopped thinking for a second and said, "I'm so sorry Ryan I. . .I got you sick!"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan shook his head sitting up slightly and said, "Its okay sweetie, I'll be okay if you still want to. . ."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste shook her head and said, "You lay back down in bed right now and I'm going to call my mom and see what I need to do to keep you comfortable and all of that."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan sighed heavily falling back onto his bed feeling twice as miserable. Celeste came back a few minutes later a house key twirling around on her finger. She dropped it down on his dresser and as she walked in he said, "I'm sorry Celeste. . ."
    </p>
    <p>
    Quickly, far faster than he had thought possible she walked over to where he was and sat down on the edge of the bed. She cupped his face in her soft warm hands and said, "You just lay down okay and I'll take care of you. You took care of me so now its my turn to take care of you." Then she kissed his nose and stood up again. She stood up in such a way that her skirt gave off a little bit of a flash of little girl panties. They were blue today apparently, which made sense after all her outfit was blue and so were her socks. Celeste sure did like to color coordinate.
    </p>
    <p>
    He felt too bad to even think about how sexy she looked. He just collapsed back onto the bed until she came back. She had a bottle of aspirin and a big glass of water. She looked at him and said, "Where do you keep your thermometer?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan coughed and said, "In the bathroom the drawer beside the sink." Celeste put the water and aspirin down on his bedside table and then headed into the bathroom. She came out a few seconds later holding the thermometer and gave it to him. Ryan put it in his mouth and waited for the beep. He groaned when he saw the temperature. Celeste took it looking at it and he said, "What's the verdict doctor?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste shook her head and said, "You're sick!"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan laughed, "I know that!"
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste just climbed up onto the bed sitting on the bed right next to him her back side resting almost even with his stomach. She grabbed the water and the aspirin and said, "You have to take two of these it'll help with the fever."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan swallowed the pills and as he laid back on the bed again he said, "When did you learn all of this?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste shrugged her shoulders, "I dunno its just what my mom always tells me when I get sick." She giggled a little and then noticed that he had a television in his room and said, "Can I turn it on?" Amazing how she could turn tracks so suddenly sometimes. Ryan nodded and she flipped the television on and then laid down beside him on the bed. He laid on his back and she laid down on her side resting her head right on his bare chest. She was obviously watching the cartoons but her hand was resting on his stomach and playing with the little bit of hair that he did have there. She seemed almost "content" to just lay there like this. He rested his hand on her back softly rubbing it and as he did he seemed to grow content as well.
    </p>
    <p>
    He was turned on but he was also too sick and too tired to even think about how beautiful she was. All he knew was that she felt soft against him and that she wanted this intimacy. He was drifting in and out of sleep when he felt her lips press to his forehead. She was sitting up on the bed now her legs folded under her. Her eyes had real concern in them. He coughed and said, "What's the matter?"
    </p>
    <p>
    She shook her head and said, "You're still really hot. I thought the aspirin was supposed to break the fever."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan took her hand squeezing it and said, "I'm okay sweetie, hand me the thermometer." Celeste reached over to the table and handed him the thermometer again as he put in his mouth he smiled at her. It beeped a little bit later and he took it out reading it. His temperature was the same as before. Celeste was right it hadn't broken at all. He rubbed one of her arms as he said, "I wanted to take you to the carnival today. . ."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste just smiled and said, "Its okay, I mean we can go some other time." She laid her head back down on his chest and said, "Plus I kinda like quiet time like this."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan ran a hand through her hair as she rubbed his stomach and something occurred to him. Celeste didn't see his outside. Oh she knew it was there, but looks weren't important to her. Young girls her age had not yet been taught by society to look at the shape of the body. She saw inside of him more than she did outside. She saw some one that cared about her, and she wanted to return those feelings. Perhaps she even needed to return them. There was some innate part of every human, the need to love and be loved back in return.
    </p>
    <p>
    They were quiet for a while when out of the blue Celeste said, "What are you thinking about?"
    </p>
    <p>
    The question was totally out there, something that he wasn't sure how to answer. He had after all a thousand thoughts going through his head and most of them centered around Celeste. "Well I was thinking about what a good doctor you would make."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste just moved her hand a little bit and said, "What else?"
    </p>
    <p>
    "Well I was thinking about how pretty you looked today, and what a shame it was that no one was going to see your outfit."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste giggled a little as she said, "that's okay. I wore it more for you to see than anyone else anyway." Had he heard her right? She had picked out this outfit specifically for him to see her in it? He swallowed and started to say something but she interrupted him, "what else?"
    </p>
    <p>
    He wondered where this was all coming from. What was it that she was trying to get from him. "Well I was thinking about how I'm starting to get hungry."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste sat up suddenly looking at him and she said, "Then you must be feeling a little bit better?" Ryan nodded and she slipped from the bed as she said, "good I'll get you some chicken soup then!" She took off quickly and he just chuckled. About ten minutes later she came back with a bowl of chicken noodle soup and another big glass of water. She sat on the edge of the bed and watched him eat his soup when he was finished she took the bowl and said, "You better drink all of that water too." Ryan stared after her when she left. He was feeling better obviously because he couldn't help but look at her as she left and start to get hard.
    </p>
    <p>
    She came back a few minutes later as he was taking another sip of his water and she smiled a little bit standing in the doorway. He swallowed some more water and said, "It is a very pretty outfit."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste blushed a little and then walked back over to where he was. She looked down and said, "You really think its just pretty?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan chuckled, "Well what is it that you think I think it is?" Okay so he had just horribly worded that question.
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste blushed a little more and said, "I dunno I just thought that you might really like it."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan sat up a little and said, "I really do like it Celeste. I think the outfit makes you look beautiful."
    </p>
    <p>
    She smiled and walked further into the room as she did she said, "can I lay down and watch some more cartoons with you?" Ryan patted the bed next to him and she laid down again. She rested her head on his chest and as she did she said, "I like being with you, it makes me feel safe."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan ran a hand through her hair. "I like having you here with me Celeste. You do something to me that no girl has done in a long while."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste did not respond to that instead she moved a little bit on his chest and then came out with, "I've never had a real boyfriend before, not like you are."
    </p>
    <p>
    "How do you mean sweetheart?"
    </p>
    <p>
    She snuggled in closer yet again and said, "You know someone who cares about me."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan softly rubbed her back and said, "Well I do care about you."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste put her head on one of her hands so she could look at him as she said, "like my mom and dad care about me?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan swallowed, "kind of like how they care about you. I just care about you in a different way than they do."
    </p>
    <p>
    She thought about this for a long while taking in the new information and then said, "you want more than this. . .you want to have an in. .inta. . intimate relationship with me?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan swallowed again and this time he felt like his head was really spinning and it wasn't because of the fever that had mostly passed. "This is the most of what I expect from this relationship with you Celeste."
    </p>
    <p>
    She looked at him and then resting her head on his chest again she said, "You really just want this from me? Not anything else?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan hugged her closer to him rubbing her back and said, "just this not anything else." They were both quiet for a while until Ryan said, "you are very special to me."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste snuggled in closer and said, "You like young girls like me don't you? I mean that's why you got that picture on your computer of a young girl. . ."
    </p>
    <p>
    It was the hardest thing to admit your truth to someone that you care so deeply about. Celeste was only nine, but she seemed to know things and he had a feeling that he like most of society had seriously under estimated just how smart nine year olds were. "Yes I am a lover of girls around your age."
    </p>
    <p>
    "So. . .so you want to do things with me right? Like be intimate?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan felt his heart stop as he caught his breath and then quietly said, "I. . .well. . ."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste just moved her head on his chest and said, "And one day you won't love me like this anymore?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan swallowed, "That will never happen Celeste. I will always love you like this Celeste. Its not something that will just go away because you get older. Its hard to explain and it would take a long time for me to explain it all."
    </p>
    <p>
    She looked up at him and said, "but you will explain it all to me?"
    </p>
    <p>
    "Yes I will explain it all to you."
    </p>
    <p>
    She laid back down and said, "I'm not stupid. . .most the girls in my third grade class aren't stupid. . .I mean we know where babies come from. . .and all of that." She paused for a while before continuing with her thought, "we were told once that some older men might try to take us or something. Or that someone we know might want to touch us where we don't want to be touched. . ."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan softly said, "They are right you might, do you know what to do in case that happens."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste nodded and they were both quiet again. Finally she said, "Is it wrong if I wanted it? I mean if I made the decision is that wrong?"
    </p>
    <p>
    She was innocent in all of this, he had to remind himself about that. For the first time in her life Celeste was stepping out of boundaries that society had placed on her. Society had told this child that she wouldn't, that she couldn't want sex. Society had told her that it wasn't something she should even be interested in (with an adult man or with a boy her own age). Like any girl though she was curious and she wanted to know. "That depends why would you be making this decision?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste thought for a while and said, "I think I would make the decision with you because I wanted you to be with me like how my mom and dad use to be with each other before when I was younger."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan stroked her back softly as he said, "If you did decide to go that way Celeste we would have to talk with your mom about it."
    </p>
    <p>
    "We would?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan swallowed, "yes, if I was your age it wouldn't matter, but I'm twenty-six years old Celeste. That's a very big age difference between the two of us."
    </p>
    <p>
    "But I love you. . .shouldn't I. . .I mean we be able to express our love?"
    </p>
    <p>
    He could hear the confusion in her voice. She saw love being expressed between two people in movies, or with her parents. She didn't see age, it wasn't anything to her. Age was just a number to her. Celeste didn't see a separating barrier between their age differences. All she saw was someone who took care of her, who cared deeply for her, and who would never harm her. She saw in Ryan the perfect adult man, the perfect boyfriend to learn from. Not just about sex, but about intimacy and relationships and how they worked. She wanted him to be her guide. . .he could not turn it down and he knew that her mom was incapable of guiding her though this understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
    He answered her question with honesty, "we should be able to Celeste, but the government doesn't think that we should. They think that men like me are only out to hurt and sub-verse or coerce girls your age into sex."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste looked up at him and said, "Sub-verse, coerce?"
    </p>
    <p>
    "It basically means to force you into something you don't want to do or make you think that you want to do it."
    </p>
    <p>
    "Oh. . .but I've been thinking about it for a few days. . .when I uh. . umm...touch myself I uhh. . .well. . ." She trailed off. Ryan couldn't help but think: she touches herself oh god!!
    </p>
    <p>
    "I understand Celeste. Believe me! I told you that the government thinks it is wrong. That's why we have to talk to your mom. If she says its okay then we can pursue a more intimate relationship with one another."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste rested her head back on his chest again and as she did she said, "If my mom says yes you're not going to like make me do something are you?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan rubbed her back again and said, "I would never make you do something that makes you uncomfortable Celeste. There is one absolute rule in this relationship, you are the leader I am the follower. You take us where you want us to go. . .I just follow and give you what you need when you are ready for it and nothing more."
    </p>
    <p>
    She hugged him so tightly that he almost gasped then she said, "You make me feel like I'm the most special thing in your world."
    </p>
    <p>
    "That's because you are Celeste." They laid like that for a long while after that both of them drifting in and out of sleep. Around seven Celeste's mom came and got her and the two went back to her place. He got a call that night from Celeste though to make sure that he was still doing okay. That next week when school started again on Monday was spent just as the past weeks had been. They talked a lot but nothing moved anywhere that Celeste wasn't ready for. He knew that the questions she had asked were a testing ground and amazingly he had somehow passed it. She was a little bit more open with her hugs and her kisses on his lips lasted longer than they had before. It wasn't until that Saturday that she broached it again it was to ask him if she would talk with her mom about what was happening. Ryan wondered how he was gong to survive that with his balls still intact. Asking a nine year olds mother if he could be intimate with her had to be suicide didn't it?

    </h1>
    </p>
    <p>
    It was about two in the afternoon and Celeste's mom had asked him to watch her while she ran to the grocery store. The nine year old had sat down on the couch beside him nearly thirty minutes ago and the two of them hadn't moved. Her arm kept brushing against his but Ryan didn't say or do anything. They had been spending a lot of quiet time together like this during the week. Long looks had replaced talks and he wasn't sure what some of those looks from Celeste meant. Last Saturday for a very long time they had talked about what it all meant. She had asked him so many questions last Saturday and that Monday as well. Questions that he hadn't been sure how to answer, but he had answered them.
    </p>
    <p>
    Not really questions about sex either, it was more questions about himself, who he was, and why he was who he was. She had not seemed mad about any of it, and none of it had appeared to upset her either. He had given her one page of his own written words and she had looked them over reading everything that described what a lover of little girls was. After reading it she had just hugged him for a very long time and the two of them had said nothing else to one another. She had kept the paper and he had a feeling it was tucked away somewhere special.
    </p>
    <p>
    He had always thought there was something that people missed about nine year olds. Celeste was highly intelligent and very aware of the world around her. She still liked to play, and be a little girl, but as far as he could tell she was also very aware of the world around her. They had not spoken about any of it after that first day and he was worried that she was starting to see him differently. Yet at the same time he knew she was processing a lot of things. She was thinking about what he had told her, and what she had read.
    </p>
    <p>
    They were both watching television but not really watching it and Ryan wondered exactly what she was thinking about. Where all of this was going was beyond him. He loved and cared for Celeste so deeply though that at times he worried that telling her all of this had pushed her away and that the two of them wouldn't ever be the same. He had told a nine year old girl that he was a pedophile! He had shown her things, explained things to her, taken away a part of her innocence, and he had to live with all of that.
    </p>
    <p>
    That's why when she said, "Is it lonely?" He had been taken completely by surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
    He looked over at her and found her large sky blue eyes on him and he said, "is what lonely?"
    </p>
    <p>
    "Being what you are?"
    </p>
    <p>
    "Not lonely, not exactly. Its hard though."
    </p>
    <p>
    She rested her head on his shoulder and said, "I'm sorry."
    </p>
    <p>
    "For what Celeste?"
    </p>
    <p>
    "For being so quite the past week. I've been thinking. . .and trying to understand. You love me, you'd never hurt me, yet you'd be taken away from me in an instant if my mom decided that you were going to do just that."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan swallowed realizing that his mouth had just gone very dry, "all very true."
    </p>
    <p>
    "There are a lot of guys out there like you. . ."
    </p>
    <p>
    Quietly, "how do you know that?"
    </p>
    <p>
    She looked up at him and said, "If you want to know something that you don't know about you go online. I mean you look things up. There are a lot of chat rooms where older men want to meet younger girls. . ." She quickly looked down and said, "I didn't go there don't worry. I know about it though. I. . .I found this place and it's a forum for girls and I asked a question. . .and other girls around my age responded telling me about their own experiences. Even one of the admins who was an older woman told me some things and pointed me to another forum. . .and well that's when I discovered that you weren't lying with the words you wrote."
    </p>
    <p>
    Silence hung around them, a quiet silence that seemed to fill the air. Ryan swallowed and said, "I wouldn't lie to you ever Celeste."
    </p>
    <p>
    "I know that. . .but I had to know for myself. I want to know more things. . .things I never though about, things I don't quite understand. I didn't get it. . .I mean why do I dress up for you? Why does my heart beat faster when I'm about to see you again, or when you kiss me on the forehead or hug me close to you? I. . .I know you look at me. . .and I guess that's why I dress for you. . .but. . .I mean why?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan touched her chin with his finger turning her up to look at him and he said, "I didn't want to push you into this world. . .I don't want you to come here into a place like this by rushing yourself. There are still a lot of years left for you to grow in and you don't have to push yourself because of my desires. I am secondary in our relationship."
    </p>
    <p>
    She looked away and said, "I know its all about me and what I want to know. I just want to know why you like me."
    </p>
    <p>
    "You mean do I like you just because you are still so young?" She nodded as she did he pulled her really close to him and said, "no Celeste, the answer is no. This is all complex. If its too much for you we can forget it go back to just being who we were before all of this. . ."
    </p>
    <p>
    She sat up suddenly and he saw tears in her eyes as she moved sitting on his lap so that she could face him directly and she said, "It is hard to understand. . .but I don't want to forget it."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan stroked her cheeks wiping the tears away as he said, "I have felt like as if I have been tearing away your innocence the last few days. . .and I don't want to make you into someone you aren't ready to be yet. . .or let you see some part of the world you aren't ready to see yet."
    </p>
    <p>
    She swallowed, "I knew what sex was before all of this."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan softly stroked one of her cheeks, "I know you did sweetheart but one day you might regret me, hate me for what I did even if it is just this."
    </p>
    <p>
    She shook her head, "how could I hate you? How could I regret learning any of this from you?"
    </p>
    <p>
    "You could. . .someone might tell you that I was wrong to even contemplate these things with you."
    </p>
    <p>
    She sniffed, "contemplate?"
    </p>
    <p>
    "Discuss, think about, explain, tell. . ."
    </p>
    <p>
    She shook her head, "No one could tell me that. No one could make me see that." She had tears in her eyes and Ryan suddenly realized that he did as well. This was tearing at both of them and he wasn't sure what was going to happen. It was a breaking point. A nine year old coming to grips for the first time with love. With what it meant, and a twenty six year old coming to realize just how special this little angel he had found truly was. "When. . .when you hold me I feel special. I can feel how much you love me when you talk to me, or when you just hug me. Even when you kiss me. . .I can feel it. I know what feelings are! NO. . no. . .no one could tell me that I don't." She looked so defiant even with tears rolling down her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan wiped at her eyes again and as he did she wiped at his own and laid her herself against him. Her head resting on his shoulder. Ryan stroked her back and as he did he said, "It's not going to be easy, but then again nothing in this world truly worth having is ever easy."
    </p>
    <p>
    She snuggled in closer rubbing her crotch right up against his before she said, "Am I really worth having?" He didn't think for a second that she was doing anything sexual, in fact he was pretty sure that she wasn't even aware of it.
    </p>
    <p>
    He ran a hand through her hair, "more than anything else on earth." They were both quite again for a while and while he stroked her hair she rested right against him. She felt so warm and soft in his arms that he had to try and stay calm and not get hard but that was pretty much a very difficult thing to do. "You're mom might pull us apart when you tell her about this."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste pulled back till her eyes met his and she said, "I really have to tell her everything?" Ryan nodded, "will you be there with me?"
    </p>
    <p>
    He hugged her deeply and said, "Yes I will be here with you when you tell her Celeste. I wouldn't abandon you to take this kind of a burden upon yourself. In fact I will be the one to tell her that I wish to be intimate with her daughter. . ."
    </p>
    <p>
    "And she will contemplate it?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan smiled, "yes and while she does that she will also probably ask you a lot of questions about why you want this." Celeste nodded and laid back against Ryan again. A few minutes later her mom came home and the two of them helped her unload the car. It was back in the Appletree apartment when he finally closed the door one last time and helped unload the groceries that things got strangely subdued. Celeste kept looking from her mom to her boyfriend and he could see it in her eyes she was a little scared, but he was terrified. Helen Appletree held all of the cards literally in her hands. She was the ultimate decision maker. She could tell them both no, make Ryan stop seeing her daughter (no matter the cost to Celeste) and even put him in jail at this point. All it would take would be some lies, after all so few in the legal system actually believed anything a child said.
    </p>
    <p>
    Helen looked at him and Ryan swallowed as he said, "Mrs. Appletree we need to talk." Okay he had gotten those words out and it hadn't been as hard as he thought it would be.
    </p>
    <p>
    Helen looked at her daughter and then at Ryan and said, "Yes I think that we do." They all walked into the living room. He took a seat on the couch and Celeste sat down next to him as her mother took a seat in the one chair in the living room.
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan swallowed and said, "I love your daughter."
    </p>
    <p>
    Helen nodded, "I have known this for nearly a month now what's your point?"
    </p>
    <p>
    "I love Ryan too mom."
    </p>
    <p>
    Helen looked at her daughter and said, "I know that as well though I imagine both of you see the love differently from one another."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan looked at Celeste for a minute debating on rather he should be fully honest and risk hurting her. Then he decided that if he hurt her that meant she wasn't really ready to learn all of this, or understand what his feelings for her are. "I am certain that our way of seeing love is very different but I can assure you that the love I have for your daughter and the love she has for me are both real."
    </p>
    <p>
    Helen nodded, "yes I am sure that they are as well."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan took Celeste's hand suddenly squeezing it for strength perhaps and said, "Celeste has expressed to me her desire for us to explore and understand our feelings for one another. . ." He didn't want to come out and say: I'd like to have sex with your daughter with your permission of course. He wanted this to be delicate and worded carefully so that Helen would understand that it wasn't about the sex at all.
    </p>
    <p>
    She looked from him to her daughter and as she was about to say something Celeste said, "I want to understand what it all is about mom and I want Ryan to be the one that explains it to me."
    </p>
    <p>
    Helen closed her mouth looking hard at her daughter and then she leaned back in her chair and said, "You could have gone behind my back."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan nodded, "I could have but its not a very honest thing to do. Especially not when I want a relationship with your daughter."
    </p>
    <p>
    Helen nodded, "I know what you are, I knew from the moment that I first saw you, and how you interacted with my daughter. I didn't push you away despite the risks. Because I knew deep inside that you were good, and that you would be good for my daughter. When I was Celeste's age there was an older man that lived on our block, all the kids loved him and his wife, but it was him that all the young girls adored. He was a new father so it wasn't like we could play wit his kid. But he was our friend and he was very honest with us and treated us like we were real people." She paused looking from Ryan to Celeste and said, "I never had a real relationship with him and I don't think he ever did anything sexual to any of the girls on my block, more than likely because he was married and didn't want to cheat on his wife. Or maybe one or two girls did invite him to touch them. . .all I know is that he never would have done it just because he wanted it."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan nodded, "there is a man like that I am certain on every block of every subdivision."
    </p>
    <p>
    Helen chuckled, "and in every apartment complex. Most just don't get as close as you and Celeste have gotten. I can't deny the relationship I see here. The two of you. . .the way that you treat my daughter it truly is beautiful. She needs you, and I don't even understand why. As a parent perhaps I can't understand why. The whole issue of being a parent always gets in the way. If I tore her away from you it would break something inside of her. I know that much for certain. She would feel lost again and I don't want to hurt my daughter in that way." She paused swallowing and said, "If Celeste wants an intimate relationship with you, if she truly desires one then I will let you have one. Just please don't do something stupid in public."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan looked at Helen and then Celeste and said, "We would never do anything stupid in public I would make sure of that."
    </p>
    <p>
    Helen nodded and said, "I need to talk to my daughter alone for a little bit." Ryan stood and started towards the door but Helen said, "Please stay, just go in Celeste's room and when we are done she will come get you." Ryan nodded. He was in Celeste's room holding her teddy bear looking around at things for nearly forty minutes when she finally opened the door. She looked at him for a long time then walked over to where he was. Ryan didn't say anything he just hugged her and she hugged him back just as tightly. Then her mom said from the doorway, "Dinner will be ready shortly."
    </p>
    <p>
    After dinner Celeste took a shower and Ryan found himself wondering what to say to Helen. He was surprised when she broke the ice by saying, "I told my daughter not to let you put it inside of her until she was older."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan gulped almost swallowing his water down the wrong hole and said, "You. . .told her what?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Helen chuckled, "She does know what sex is, I would not let my daughter walk into the world ignorant. There are too many perverts out there." She looked at him hard and said, "Just so you know I don't think you are a pervert. I think I understand you a lot better now after looking at those websites my daughter visited. Just don't try something she isn't ready for."
    </p>
    <p>
    "Its up to her Helen, not me. It goes in the direction that Celeste wants it to go. Not in the direction that I want it to go. The relationship leans more on her needs and wants not mine. One day in the future perhaps it will change, one day perhaps it will be more equal but for now. . ." Helen nodded and just then Celeste came out of the bathroom in her nightgown. She took Ryan's hand and he followed her into her bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
    She climbed up onto her bed and the nightgown she wore tonight was shorter than the previous ones. It stopped at about the middle of her thighs and as she climbed up into bed it rode up to reveal plain white cotton panties. She giggled when she saw him looking as she laid down on the bed. Then she pushed the covers up around herself. Ryan sat down on the edge of the bed and she put her hand up. He threaded his fingers with hers and the nine year old girl said, "I love you."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan leaned down and lightly kissed her lips once and then squeezed her hand before letting go and saying, "I love you too sweetie."
    </p>
    <p>
    He started to stand up as Celeste said, "can I have a real goodnight kiss?" Ryan smiled and leaned down again. His lips touched hers softly and they kissed for a long while their lips meeting. He could smell her toothpaste. Then he pulled back and she smiled up at him a small blush on her cheeks. He started to turn the dresser light on but she said, "Leave it off."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan turned to look at her and said, "Not afraid of the dark anymore?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste shook her head, "I know that you'd never let any monster in the dark come and get me. . .so what's there to be afraid of?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan swallowed and walked back to where she was. He sat down beside her on the bed again and stroked one of her cheeks as he said, "there is nothing to be afraid of Celeste, in the dark or anywhere else. If you spend all of your time being afraid you'll never live."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste nodded and hugged him suddenly as she said, "I use to be afraid of the dark cause that's where my mom and dad did all of their fighting, in the dark. I could hear them screaming at one another and then my daddy left and I was so scared after that. So scared that if I turned my light off and stayed in the dark again that my mom would leave too. . ."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan could hear the tears in her voice. He hugged her close to him holding her in his arms as she cried. He pushed her hair back from her forehead and kissed her there again before tucking her back into the bed and he said, "you're mom's not going to leave you, and I won't leave you until you no longer need me."
    </p>
    <p>
    He turned out the light and as he did she said, "I'll always need you Ryan. . ."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan kissed her forehead in the dark as she rolled over and snuggled into her bed with her sheets around her and as she softly drifted off into sleep he said, "I will always love you little one." That night as he laid in bed Ryan wondered what exactly he had gotten himself into. What he didn't know was that it wouldn't be until two weeks later that he would discover just that. . .

    </h1>
    </p>
    <p>
    It wasn't like it just happened like magic. Ryan knew that he couldn't expect for Celeste to just want SEX all the sudden because her mom had said it was okay for her to learn about it. Celeste like any little girl had a mind that worked very differently than an adult mind. For her having permission was a good thing, but it wasn't all that she needed. There would be a time in the future he knew when he would touch Celeste but he wasn't going to make her rush it. It would be at Celeste's pace and for her not for him. That next week everything went by normal except for one thing: Celeste went to stay with her dad for the entire weekend.
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan missed her greatly but he understood why she had to do it. The week following was pretty normal as well though he did notice that even when he was working she would come into his office sometimes and sit on his lap just watching what he was doing without saying anything. She was a great comfort and she seemed to know this. She had asked him what his name was on the forums and he had told her. A few days after he had told her what his name was she had gotten in the car at school when he picked her up and said, "You told them about me?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan had swallowed and said, "I. . I yeah I guess I did."
    </p>
    <p>
    She looked over at him and said, "You said I was beautiful and that you thought I was sexy too? How. . .how am I sexy?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan had swallowed that day and he had managed though to answer her, "just by being yourself. That's what makes you sexy. You are who you are and that's what I like most about you."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste seemed to think about this a little bit and then she had said, "So you don't want me to dress like Britney Spears?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan had looked over at her and said, "Why would I want you to dress like that?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste had shrugged as she answered him, "some boys at my school think she's hot." That had been where the topic had basically stopped. Ryan had noticed though after that day that she seemed more aware of when he looked at her. She seemed to tease him more often too. Nothing too drastic and he knew that she was just testing her limits with him. What she had found out that following week was her limits stretched very far indeed. She could tease him all she wanted without even having to worry about him doing something to her.
    </p>
    <p>
    Friday almost two weeks after he and Celeste had talked with her mom he got a phone call. There was nothing unusual about that as far as Ryan was concerned but when he realized that it was Celeste's mom he wondered to himself why she was calling. He picked up on the second ring and said, "Hello Helen is everything okay?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Helen laughed and said, "I should have known that anyone with as much technical junk as you would have caller ID." Ryan chuckled and Helen said, "I need to ask you a favor. I was going to ask Jack," That was Celeste's father, "but he's out of town this weekend. Hold on a second." She put the phone on hold and he had to listen to muzak. He hated being put on hold on phones like this. Finally the line came back again and Helen said, "Sorry about that."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan just said, "Its okay don't worry about it. What did you need to ask me Helen?"
    </p>
    <p>
    "Right. . .I need someone to watch Celeste this Friday and Saturday night. She was going to go stay at Amanda's for the weekend but she can't now. Amanda caught the flu and can't even get out of bed to eat. So I need someone to watch her since Amanda's parents had to back out. You seem like the only choice I have."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan smiled on his end of the phone and said, "you don't have to worry about it Helen. I can watch Celeste. She is a pleasure and I already do it on the weekdays anyway."
    </p>
    <p>
    Helen seemed to think for a minute and said, "Its different now because of how the two of you are different with one another. I don't know if I like the idea of her spending a night alone with someone that she considers more than a friend."
    </p>
    <p>
    "Nothing is going to happen Helen you know that I could never harm Celeste."
    </p>
    <p>
    Helen sighed, "I know. Okay then I'm going to ask you to please watch my daughter this weekend. I should be home on Sunday in the early afternoon."
    </p>
    <p>
    "Not a problem." Ryan put the phone down and sighed. So he was going to be spending an entire two days with Celeste. He tired to think of some activities he could plan out for them. There had been a Friday a few weeks back that she had stayed at Amanda's. He had missed her terribly then as well, but he had known that sometimes a little girl had to spend time with her friends. He went and picked Celeste up at the usual time and as she got into the car he said, "I'm supposed to be watching you this entire weekend."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste looked over at him and said, "Don't you watch me everyday?"
    </p>
    <p>
    In more ways than one, eh thought in his head, "Yes I do but what I mean is you're staying with me for the weekend."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste nodded and said, "Yeah I already knew that." She was dressed today in a dark purple shirt with two hearts connected to one another of different purple colors, and a pleated skirt of dark blue color that stopped at about the middle of her thighs. Ryan wondered what kind of panties she had on. They arrived at the apartment and Celeste went over to her own to get a few things and came back carrying a small suitcase. She sat it down in his bedroom and said, "Where am I going to be sleeping?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan smiled from the doorway of his bedroom and said, "You can sleep in here. I'll sleep on the couch."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste looked over at him and then back at his bed before saying, "we. . .could..uhh share your bed that way we're both comfortable."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan smiled and said, "We'll talk about that later tonight when its closer to bedtime okay?" Celeste nodded and the two of them walked out of the bedroom as they did he said, "what do you want to do for dinner tonight, since its just going to be the two of us?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste shrugged her shoulders and said, "You could make some of that spaghetti I had the last time you cooked for me and mom." Nearly two weeks ago he had cooked for Helen and Celeste.
    </p>
    <p>
    He chuckled, "okay spaghetti it is. Let me just make sure that I have everything I need." HE checked for everything and when he was satisfied he nodded to himself and started work on the sauce putting it into a pan and covering it. It would take a while for the sauce to cook. Celeste had sat down on the couch and was watching cartoons. She laid down as he looked over at her and Ryan caught a glimpse of her panties. He couldn't see them for more than a second but he had a feeling that they had some cartoon character on them.
    </p>
    <p>
    He took one more look in her direction then headed off to his office. He was working on some files when Celeste walked in. She didn't speak she just sat down on his lap and watched him for a long while. After about thirty minutes of watching him she said, "What's it like?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan stopped collating files and with his one free hand resting on her leg he softly rubbed it right above the knee and said, "What is what like sweetie?"
    </p>
    <p>
    "Sex."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan swallowed and turned away from his computer. Celeste turned around on his lap so that she was facing him. Thankfully his desk chair's arm rests had holes in them that she could stick her feet in. Unfortunately her panties were hidden by the skirt she wore, which was a shame but he wasn't going to complain. Ryan had gotten more than two dozen panties shots from Celeste in the near two months that he had known her. Most of them he had been sure were accidental, but some of them had been ones she had planned. The young girl was testing her flirting skills with someone that she knew would not hurt her. Girls had to learn how to flirt from somewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
    He had always answered any question that she had asked and he wasn't going to stop doing so. "That's a hard question to answer. So I'm going to ask you one. What do you think sex is Celeste?"
    </p>
    <p>
    She thought for a few minutes and said, "I think its something that two people who care about each other share with each other is that right?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan nodded, "most sex is about two people sharing a common interest and wanting to express that interest and their own love for one another. There are some out there who think that sex is there to take from someone else who doesn't want it taken from them."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste looked down at their crotches and then she looked back up at him and said, "You want to have sex with me don't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan shook his head and said, "No I want to be intimate with you Celeste. There is a big difference. I desire to have sex with you but its not something I need to make myself feel our relationship is complete. Us just the way we are works fine to me. There is nothing wrong with just being this close to you. . .do you understand?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste thought for a long while and then said, "So what you're saying is you desire me but you would never make the first move? You would never force yourself on me?" Ryan nodded and again Celeste seemed to think for a long while before finally her cheeks turned red as she said, "Sometimes when I know that you're looking at my panties. . .or at my legs. . or at my face. . .or anywhere on my body I get these tingles and not just at the spot you are looking at. Sometimes the tingles feel really good when I touch myself."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan stroked one of her cheeks as he said, "it is perfectly normal for a girl your age to explore herself."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste nodded, "I know my mom said the same thing. She also told me that I use to do it in public when I was under the age of five. But I don't remember that." Ryan smiled and she blushed deeper putting her head on his chest for a little bit. Finally she said, "If I asked to see if you could make the tingles feel really good would you tell me that I can't?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan's heart skipped a beat, his penis began to harden and his thoughts began circulating around what Celeste had just said. He stroked her back his hand resting there as he said, "I wouldn't say that Celeste. What I would say is: why do you want me to?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste looked up at him a little bit of confusion on her face then quietly she said, "Because I want to know what its like." He wanted to ask her if she would ever look back on this and regret it. He wanted to know if he was stepping over some boundary that had been placed up centuries upon centuries ago where grown men just weren't supposed to touch little girls even if they wanted it cause it left them scarred. Yet before the recent modern society lots of young girls had been touched he couldn't remember seeing anything about thousands of women coming forth and saying that they didn't want to be touched as children. Though some regretted it in later life not all of them did. Would Celeste though? Ryan didn't have the answer and he knew that whatever choice he made, no whatever choice they made together would have to be for both of them and would have to be risked.
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan stroked her back softly and said, "I will touch you if you want me too. If you want me to stop though. . ."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste nodded and looked up at him as she said, "How are you going to do it?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan smiled and leaned over lightly kissing her lips as he said, "we'll go watch television I'll just rub your leg like I always do and work my way up slowly. If you don't like it. . .or if you feel uncomfortable. . ."
    </p>
    <p>
    "I know Ryan." They moved into the living room and as he sat down on the couch she sat down on his lap a little hard pushing her bottom right into his crotch. He groaned but she just giggled and said, "Sorry." He let her put on whatever show she wanted and then with her head resting against his shoulder and his hand resting on one of her legs and the other one on her stomach over her shirt they watched the cartoons. The sauce had another hour or so before he would have to check on it.
    </p>
    <p>
    He didn't start right away. All he did at first while they watched the cartoons was rub her leg. He loved the silky softness of her legs. How smooth and how warm they were. There was nothing he decided like touching a little girl. Gently he caressed her lovingly as he had done many times before. Celeste seemed fully at ease but as his hand moved up further on her leg and his caresses came closer to her panties she gave an intake of breath. He thought she wanted him to stop but he could hear the faint sound of her heart beating that was how close she was to him. Her heart was beating a little quicker and as his hand slipped up a little further she spread her legs open a little bit giving him more access to her leg. She let her breath out and moved her head on his chest. HE could feel her breath now coming out of her nose.
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan thought about stopping. He couldn't believe that he was doing this. His hand was on Celeste's upper thigh now rubbing the top of it, feeling the wonderful smoothness of her thigh. In his own pants he was throbbing with his need. He suppressed his own desires for this was not about him at all. He rubbed at her upper thigh applying a little bit more pressure and as he did Celeste seemed to whimper with her breath. He could feel each breath coming from her nose now against his neck and it was growing more intense with each breath.
    </p>
    <p>
    The hand that he had rested on her stomach now slipped under her shirt and was rubbing her flat little stomach with its outward belly button. She gave a small sigh when he stroked her inner thigh. His hand brushed against little girl panties. For the first time in his life he touched little girl panties while they were still on the girl. HE could feel the warmth radiating from them. A warmth that he knew came from Celeste's cunny.
    </p>
    <p>
    He brushed the panties again and this time when he did the nine year old girl in his arms jumped a little. Not in surprise, not in fear, but in genuine desire. She was breathing very heavily now and he wondered if she was wet or not. He pushed his hand on her stomach up a little bit more running it over one of her erect nipples and as he ran his fingers over the nipple Celeste gave off a, "ohhhhhhhh!" As her breath escaped from her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
    He was being gentle and loving, as he knew that was what she needed. As he rubbed her other nipple his hand brushed over her panties again. Celeste seemed to respond by opening her legs until one of them fell almost completely off of his own legs. If she wasn't facing the television he was pretty certain that she would have been showing him her panties perfectly. She was giving off these little, "Ohhh!" every time that he rubbed at her inner thigh now and Ryan knew that it was a signal.
    </p>
    <p>
    He rested his hand on her panties. Under his fingers he could feel the lips of her cunny. He could feel the lips of a nine year olds cunny! Ryan tried not to get excited but he found it a little hard not to. He had been invited by this nine year old to make her feel good and that was what he was going to do. He rubbed the lips of her cunny through the cotton and as he did Celeste cried out suddenly with a, "ohhhh ohhhh ohhhhh it ohhhhhh!" He could tell by her sounds and the way that she was moving slightly against him that she was turned on by what he was doing. Her little bottom was practically digging into his crotch though he doubted she was aware of his hard on.
    </p>
    <p>
    He could feel where her panties were a little wet as well. Ryan knew that it was now or never. He ran his fingers over the band of her panties tracing it and then slowly pushed his hand down under the band. She was so hot under her panties that he was surprised his hand didn't burn. He could feel her desire with his hand and as he pushed down over the bottom part of her stomach he knew that Celeste was about to enter into another realm. His fingers lightly brushed the lips of her cunny from under the panties.
    </p>
    <p>
    The nine year old jumped but not in a I am scared and want you to stop manner. She wanted more it seemed. He brushed the lips again this time with two fingers and as he did he ran them down over the lips. Ryan had never touched bald preteen pussy and even though he had imagined doing it he had never actually done it. He could hardly believe that he was doing it now. He traced the lips feeling the shape of them. They were soft and squishy and there was a slight wetness to them too. As he pushed against them a little bit with his fingers Celeste cried out again with more of her, "oohhhhhhh!" The lips spread easily and as he ran his fingers along the inside folds of her cunny Ryan became entranced. He had felt adult women this way but never a little girl.
    </p>
    <p>
    HE felt it, her little clit. A small little nub that was sticking out from the folds right above it. He ran his finger over the nub and as he did Celeste's eyes got really big and she groaned so loudly that he was afraid that his neighbors might have heard. It was one long continuous grown as he rubbed at her little clit. Each tweak would send another bit of pleasure up to the little girl's brain. That was definitely what she was feeling. It wasn't some trick that he had put on her. It wasn't some kind of abuse. Celeste was feeling something that came natural to all humans, she was feeling what pleasure was all about.
    </p>
    <p>
    He rubbed at her clit, his fingers running around it, pushing up on it and then he felt it. One of his fingers ran over the little hole that slipped into her body. Ryan traced this little hole and as he did he leaned over and whispered in Celeste's ear, "Can I put my finger in you?" The nine year olds eyes were glazed over with her pleasure but she still was coherent enough to know what he was asking. She nodded and he pushed his pinky into the hole. It fit sliding in as she suddenly cried out loudly again. Her entire body shook as she started to cum again.
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan couldn't believe that this was happening. He had given a nine year old girl multiple orgasms! He was still giving her more as well as his finger slowly pushed further into her squeezing tunnel. Celeste was pushing her little bottom against his crotch now with each push of his finger further into her cunny. The nine year old was so lost in her pleasure that all she could do was moan. Suddenly it all broke. Her entire body let the flood wash over it and Ryan knew that this was it. This was the big one that her body had been signaling was coming.
    </p>
    <p>
    Finally she collapsed back onto him hard with her breath coming out of her mouth still. Her cunny still squeezed at his finger a little but as he slipped it out she gave a small sigh of relief. He slipped his hand out of her panties and brought it up to his mouth. He could smell her scent. It was unlike any adult woman that he had ever smelled. He licked one of his fingers and found her scent and her taste to both be sweet and to his liking. He cleaned his fingers off and as he did Celeste relaxed against him catching her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
    When she had caught her breath he said, "I have to check on the sauce." He was still uncomfortable in his pants but as Celeste laid down on the couch her eyes still a little glazed over he reminded himself that this was about her not about him. When he came back from the checking the sauce Celeste was sitting up on the couch putting her clothes back in order. She went to the bathroom a few seconds later and came out before sitting down on the couch beside him. She rested her head against his side and neither of them spoke. He wondered though as he sat there with her like this if she was angry at him or if she regretted it now that it was over.
    </p>
    <p>
    He thought he would have the resolve to tell her no. That she would have to sleep alone. It wasn't brought up until after they ate dinner and talked about the little things: how she was doing in school, what was wrong with Amanda, what she wanted to do for summer, or how his work was going, or what he wanted to do this summer. He was clearing the plates when Celeste said, "I'm gonna take a shower okay Ryan?" He nodded and watched her walk off to his guest shower. He felt tears in his eyes and a little bit of fear in his heart. She was so beautiful! What if he had hurt her beyond repair? What if even though she had wanted it at first she hadn't wanted it at the end after it was over? Had he violated her, taken from her that which she hadn't wanted taken yet? It worried him greatly.
    </p>
    <p>
    When she came out of the shower looking fresh all over again he said, "Do you want to stay up for a while and watch a movie?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste looked up at him and he wondered what was going on in her mind. She shook her head and said, "Not really I had a really long day I think I just want to go to sleep." Ryan nodded and she still kept looking up at him. Quietly she said, "a. ..are you going to go to sleep right now too?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan could see something in her eyes. He couldn't explain what it was. He walked over to where she was and bent down on his knees so that they were eye level and he said, "What's wrong?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste shook her head and said, "It's nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan swallowed and reached out putting his hand on her shoulder. At first he thought she might move away. He couldn't understand it there were unshed tears in her eyes, and he was so scared that he had put them there. Yet she didn't appear to be afraid of him. "Obviously its something Celeste."
    </p>
    <p>
    She swallowed back her tears and said, "I can't explain it. . .I try to. . .to myself but I don't know what I need. . .its so strange. I. . .I just want you to hold me. . .I need. . .you to hold me."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan stroked her shoulders with both of his hands, "right now right here?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste shook her head, "no. . .in there, in bed. . .I. . .I don't know why its just something I need."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan pulled her close to him and gently cupped one of her cheeks, "Then I wouldn't want to disappoint you." He stood up taking her hand as he turned off the kitchen light and walked with her into the bedroom. She climbed up into his large king sized bed showing off her white cotton panties briefly for a second and as she did he walked towards the bathroom and said, "I need to put on my night clothes and brush my teeth." Celeste just nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
    When he came out dressed in his boxers (with underwear on under them) she was sitting up in the bed some of the covers around her. He smiled and climbed in not sure where his resolve had gone. As he laid down she immediately laid beside him putting her head on his chest and one of her legs wrapped with one of his own. He started to harden having her so close to him, and feeling her soft and warm body so near had that effect on him more and more as of late.
    </p>
    <p>
    Softly as he stroked her hair he said, "I'm sorry Celeste."
    </p>
    <p>
    She moved her head a little and said, "Sorry?"
    </p>
    <p>
    "I. . .I didn't want you to regret what we did."
    </p>
    <p>
    She sat up a little bit. This nine year old that had captivated him from the first moment he had met her was looking right now deep into his soul. Her light blue eyes focused on his dark green. She shook her head and said, "I don't." Then she laid down on him again and said quietly, "it was so weird. . .though. . .I've never felt anything like it. When it happened. . .it was so big, it felt like I was going to explode. It just kept happening, it wouldn't stop. . .I never knew it was like that."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan stroked her back and said, "I thought maybe you were angry at me for doing it. . .thought that maybe you had wanted me to stop but couldn't find the words. . ."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste stayed where she was but she put her hand on his stomach and ran her fingers through the light covering of hair there as she said, "I was scared at first. When you started to move your hand up. I mean it already felt really nice, and I thought maybe it was going to stop feeling nice. . .or that I wouldn't like it. I. . .I didn't know that it felt that good. Do all girls feel that good when it happens?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan smiled as he said, "If its done right yes they do."
    </p>
    <p>
    "I want you to do it again sometime. . .but not tonight I'm too tired."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan chuckled hugging her closer to him, "me too little one." With a stifled yawn he said, "What do you want to do tomorrow?"
    </p>
    <p>
    "Can we go to the carnival, this is the last weekend that it is going to be here?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan squeezed her slightly and said, "We can and we will. I'll even buy you some cotton candy." Shortly after that both of them drifted off into sleep content and fulfilled within one another's arms. Ryan had to admit as he held Celeste she as the most incredible girl he had ever had the pleasure of knowing. . .there was no doubt about that in his mind. . none at all. He would be content to have her in his life until the day he died. He wanted to not just watch her grow into a woman, but be there to help her grow into one. Every little girl he felt needed a lover of little girls to help her grow into a wonderful and smart woman. . .perhaps it was just a dream of his. But what a lovely dream it was.

    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan woke up feeling groggy. He groaned and rolled over in his bed and shook his head as his mind came into focus and he remembered the night before. He blinked his eyes a few times and sat up slowly looking around his room. Celeste was not in the room so he slipped out of bed and looked out into the living room. The nine year old was sitting on the couch reading a book, which did not totally surprise him. He smiled standing in the doorway and said, "good morning."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste looked up from the book she was reading and said, "'morning!"
    </p>
    <p>
    He chuckled and said, "I'm going to take a shower. . .do you still want to go to the carnival?"
    </p>
    <p>
    "Yes, if you still want to." Ryan nodded and then walked into his bathroom. After showering and shaving he pulled on his clothes and walked out into the living room. Celeste had put on her own clothes as well. She wore a pair of tight jean shorts that he knew right away would mold perfectly to her little bottom, and a white shirt with spaghetti straps leaving all of her arms bare. It was a warm spring morning so he knew that she was dressed appropriately. In the car he let her pick the radio station and found himself listening to alternative rock, not that he minded. At one of the stop lights before he turned into the grass parking lot that the carnival was located next to Celeste looked at him and he looked at her and for some reason the little girl just giggled.
    </p>
    <p>
    When they got out of the car she immediately took his hand and he said, "don't wonder off while we are here, I don't want something to happen okay?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste nodded and said, "I know what can happen at a place like this to a girl my age. . ." He threaded his fingers with hers in a very intimate touch and the two of them headed into the carnival grounds. They had a fun house, many rides and many games. They were walking past one of the ring toss games when Celeste tugged at his hand. He stopped and she pointed at a stuffed teddy bear and said, "Do you think you can win that for me big guy?" She wasn't begging him to win it or anything, she just wanted to see if he would or not.
    </p>
    <p>
    He squeezed her hand and said, "I can try." He got some rings and she watched as he tossed some of them. He couldn't believe it when he landed the rings in order to win the large stuffed teddy bear and he said, "What is your mom going to say?"
    </p>
    <p>
    "That you spoiled me!" She giggled.
    </p>
    <p>
    As she giggled he handed her the teddy bear and said, "here you carry this little miss giggles-a-lot."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste actually stuck her tongue out at him and Ryan realized right away that she was playing games with him. Eventually he carried the teddy bear and held her hand in his again squeezing it every now and then. Everyone here probably thought he was her father, and that he was keeping her safe. He did wonder when at one point he hugged Celeste and saw a guy watching the two of them, if perhaps there were others like him here checking out Celeste. He knew that there were a lot of pretty little girls at the Carnival. Girls that he would have been looking at as much as possible if not for one thing. Right now Ryan only had eyes for Celeste. She was the only thing he saw. When he went to sleep at night she was in his dreams, and in his waking hours she was there as well.
    </p>
    <p>
    She went on a couple of rides that he knew were safe, like the merry-go-round. Then they slipped into the funhouse. As a kid Ryan had always loved fun houses, the mirrors were his favorite because you could do so many different shapes. Celeste was giggling at some of the faces he made and some of the different' shapes. She found a mirror that made your stomach look big and giggling she said, "Look I'm pregnant." Ryan had to admit that she did look pregnant.
    </p>
    <p>
    He chuckled and said, "Just don't tell your mom."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste giggled again and took his hand pulling him along with her. They walked through the entire fun house including the "scary" rooms but Celeste didn't seem scared at all and neither was he. Eventually they found themselves with having seen everything at the carnival. It was late in the afternoon, the sun was starting to set as they walked back towards the car. Celeste still held his hand intimately and in the car after he had put away the stuffed teddy bear in the back seat she said, "I had fun."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan smiled put his arm around her shoulders and said, "You know so did I. So what are we going to do for dinner?" She shrugged her shoulder and Ryan said, "how about we go to a nice quiet restaurant."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste's eyes got big and she said, "like on a date kind of a restaurant?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan smiled, "sure why not." She agreed and they went to a nice but inexpensive restaurant. Celeste ordered too much food for her little self but he managed to convince her to go ahead and eat what she could and not stuff her face and that they would take the rest home. Which ended up being more than half of the meal. He was impressed with how well behaved she was and even though she was well behaved she still talked a lot and Ryan found himself talking back with her. The two of them were being a little goofy as well. He kept trying to tickle her while she tired to eat the chocolate moose that he had let her order.
    </p>
    <p>
    Finally as she tried to take another bite and he tickled her she got a stern look on her face and put her hands on her waist as she said, "you stop that right now or I won't let you kiss me ever again." Thankfully there had been no one near them to hear her say that. He looked around anyway and then she blushed really deeply and said, "Sorry!" Ryan just smiled and took one of her hands in his and squeezed it before letting her eat her chocolate moose which she ended up sharing half of with him.
    </p>
    <p>
    In the car as she was bucking her seatbelt he said, "You're really never going to let me kiss you again?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste looked at him and then said, "I dunno, I'll have to think about it. . ." On the car ride home every time that they stopped at a red light or a stop sign he would reach over and tickle her. She started to get weary of stop lights and started to try and move away from his hand as quickly as possible but Ryan was a lot faster than she was. When they got back to the apartment she ran up the sidewalk and leaned against the wall beside the door as he walked up carrying the teddy bear. She stuck her tongue out at him and he stuck his out back at her which made the nine year old giggle.
    </p>
    <p>
    He opened the apartment door and she followed him in. He dropped the teddy bear down on the couch and said, "I'm trying to figure out why I won that thing for you. . ." As he said this he dropped down on the couch beside the bear. Celeste locked the door and climbed over the couch and up onto his lap until she was facing him.
    </p>
    <p>
    She looked up at him and said, "you won it for me cause I asked if you could win it or not. . ."
    </p>
    <p>
    It was amazing how a kid could be so giggly and full of fun and adventure one second and the next so serious and thoughtful. He knew not all nine year olds were like Celeste but he had met more than a few in his years that were. He stroked one of her cheeks and said, "Well I do like you a lot. . .and sometimes you're not a bothersome little brat. . ."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste stuck her tongue out and said, "I'm never a brat. ..admit it."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan leaned down to kiss her nose but she turned her face up inviting him to kiss her lips. He did lightly a few times, "okay I admit it you're not a brat. ..your sweet, and cute, and funny, and so beautiful," he stroked one of her cheeks while saying this.
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste's cheeks heated and she took one of his hands resting it on one of her legs and as he rubbed her leg she said, "Do you want to uhh you know. ..uh touch me again?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan smiled, "do you want me to touch you again?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste rested her very small hand on his larger one and said, "Yeah I do." She rubbed his hand and looked up at him her light blue eyes meeting his darker green as she said, "when you were tickling me on the ride home I kept wishing you were going down lower. . .I don't really know why."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan ran a hand down her back as he ran his fingers over spine she arched her back a little bit and he said, "I know why. Its because you liked it and you know that it felt good so you want to feel it again."
    </p>
    <p>
    "But I didn't want to feel it again earlier."
    </p>
    <p>
    "You don't have to always want to feel it Celeste. If you do feel it though and if you want me to take care of it for you I will." She nodded and he said, "So do you want me to?"
    </p>
    <p>
    She thought for a minute and then said, "After I take my shower. I feel all sweaty and icky from the carnival still." He smiled and when she slipped off of him he patted her bottom as if sending her on her way and she said, "What was that for?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan smiled, "that little one was affection." She giggled and took off to the bathroom. He took a shower as well and changed clothes. He found her on his bed sitting there looking at a picture of his mom, sisters, and one of the sister's husbands that had been taken a year ago at relatives wedding. "The lady in the middle is my mom and the two on either side of her are my sisters. The guy next to Hanna my older sister is her husband."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste put the picture down and looked up at him as she said, "does your mom know that you have a nine year old girlfriend?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan shook his head and said, "nope but I might have to introduce you to her someday. . .dunno how I would do that though."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste blushed looking up at him and she said quietly, "I want to show you something. . .but I don't know if you'll like it or not. . ."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan sat down on the bed beside her and took her small hand in his and said, "I promise you whatever you want to show me I will like." Celeste blushed still as she slipped off of his bed. At first he thought she was going to go get something but then she shocked the hell out of him. The young preteen girl took hold of her night shirt and pulled it up right over her head. Underneath she was naked. Ryan had seen naked preteen girls before in pictures. . .he had never looked at one in reality. Yet now one stood before him.
    </p>
    <p>
    Her hand quickly coved her bald cunny as if she was shy about it and he realized that she probably was. She looked even smaller without her shirt on. The girl was nine years old, less than five feet tall (probably more like four and half feet tall) she weighed less than eighty pounds and she was the single most beautiful girl he had ever seen naked. Her little nipples were about the size of pennies and they were hard as well probably more from the shock of the cold room than anything else. She had very boyish hips (which was not surprising she was only nine after all). Her stomach was flat as he already knew with a slightly outward, slightly inward belly button. Such long slender legs. . .one day she would be all legs (as the expression went). Her one hand covered her cunny lips and as he looked her over she slowly moved it away. They were perfect just like the rest of her. Not fat or pudgy, just perfectly full. He loved how the two lips folded together to form the slit that he could only see part of. There was nothing like looking at a preteen girl's bald cunny. A little girl was the absolute perfection of the female form in his opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste's cheeks were scarlet as he said, "god. . ." He was literally speechless. This little angel had given him a gift that he could still hardly believe he had received. He reached out afraid that she might be a phantom and took her hand pulling her closer to him. She stood there looking at him knowing that at that moment he could effect how she looked at herself the rest of her life. "You are so beautiful my little one. . ."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste blushed her face looking down and she said, "I. . .I am?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan stroked one of her cheeks, "yes you are." Celeste reached over and hugged him suddenly. Ryan hugged her back getting a good shot this time of her backside. God talk about perfection. She had the smallest little bottom, it was so round and perfect. . .he ran a hand over it softly touching it and as he did she jumped a little surprised at the contact. Then she pulled back from the hug and climbed up into the bed laying down on her back.
    </p>
    <p>
    He smiled as she said, "will you touch me now?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan swallowed and said, "What kind of a monster have I created?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste giggled and blushed before she said, "please?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan leaned down and kissed her nose, then her lips lightly as he said, "all you have to do baby is ask and I will do as you wish. This is your show, not mine." Celeste nodded and he knew that was her saying that she really wanted it. He knew that she would never ask about it, so he wondered if he should ask her or not. Would it be stepping over boundaries she wasn't ready to cross. He decided he would wait a little longer let her develop at her own pace. She might one day want it or she might not.
    </p>
    <p>
    He laid down beside her on his side so that his body was lengthwise with hers and he rested one of his hands on her stomach. As he softly ran circles around on her stomach with his hand she said, "That feels nice."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan smiled, "It'll feel even better soon I promise." Celeste just smiled well aware of what he meant. He circled his hand over her stomach softly rubbing it as he leaned over and kissed her lightly on the lips. His eyes kept roaming over her body as his hand slowly moved down. Celeste opened her legs inviting him in and he could see the glistening wetness on her little cunny lips already. This was a horny nine year old girl. She wanted him to touch her and he had a feeling that it wasn't going to end with him just touching her. Eventually maybe a month from now or a year from own she would want something else and she would ask for it.
    </p>
    <p>
    He ran his hand over the leg closest to him rubbing it a few times before doing this to her other leg. Celeste gave a small sigh showing that she was relaxing more. As she relaxed and as he rubbed her legs he said, "Why did you want to show me this?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste's eyes met his and she blushed deeply as she said, "I guess cause I knew that you wanted to see me naked. . .and also cause it just felt right. . ." Ryan nodded and kissed her nose lightly. There was no rushing. No great hurry on his part. He realized now that he would never rush this with Celeste, not while she was still learning about everything. Perhaps one day in the future he would be able to initiate the sexual aspect of their relationship, but for now he knew it was her game not his.
    </p>
    <p>
    He teased her by brushing his fingers along the lips and she gave a sharp intake of breath on the first sign of real pleasure. Ryan could already tell, this one was going to be as intense as the one yesterday had been. He ran his fingers over the lips of her cunny, tracing them lightly and as he did Celeste moaned a little bit in the back of her throat. He knew it now moaning was not something learned it was instinct. He rubbed the lips of her cunny again applying a little bit more pressure and as he did Celeste let out another, "oohhhh!" that filled his room.
    </p>
    <p>
    Her cunny lips were slick with her desire and as he rubbed over them he could feel the slickness of them. He traced the lips a few more times as he did he could feel his penis throbbing with his desire. He wanted to do so much more than just touch Celeste, but he knew that all of that would have to wait. Just touching her was enough for him. Hearing her pleasure, knowing that she was feeling good was enough to make him happy. He rubbed the lips of her cunny one more time and this time he was rewarded as he thought he would be. She pushed up against his hand. He looked into her eyes, they were already filled with her passion, her desire. There was no doubt about it this young girl was building to orgasm. An orgasm that society said nine year olds were incapable of feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
    He spread the lips of her cunny the rest of the way for the first time his eyes rested on the pink insides. The folds of her pussy were beautiful, and he could see through all of the pink the little clit that stood erect underneath the folds that it usually was hidden under. There as well was the little entrance to her body. It pulsated with her heartbeat and he knew that her desire was growing quickly. He ran his thumb over her clit feeling the erect little nub. As he did she cried out letting all of her breath escape from her lungs. Then she filled them up again with a big intake as he pushed his pinky against that little hole. He watched his finger slip inside this time and as it did Celeste moaned again with a long, "ohhhh!"
    </p>
    <p>
    The nine year old girl's body was on fire. She was feeling things that she had felt before, but this time they were growing more intense. Ryan told himself it was wrong, but he did it anyway. He leaned down and lightly kissed one of Celeste's nipples. The nine year olds eyes opened wide when he did this and he asked her, "should I not do that?" She shook her head no telling him he should do it. He knew it then she was loosing herself to the good feelings. Her orgasm was coming and it was growing with great intensity.
    </p>
    <p>
    She moaned loudly again and this time it was just as he sucked on one of her little nipples and his finger pushed back into the hole. As his finger pushed into the pulsating little hole he also rubbed at her clit. Suddenly that little cunny squeezed his finger hard and Ryan heard her moans cry out to him. She was cuming again, her little body riding waves of passion. She pushed against his hand, she pushed against his mouth as well which still rested on one of her nipples. She cried out over and over again as her little body shook with her orgasm. Finally she collapsed back onto the bed still breathing heavily. Ryan slipped his finger out of the hole and softly rubbed the lips of her cunny once more before tasting her juices again.
    </p>
    <p>
    The young girl was sweating a little and still breathing very heavily as he laid there beside her softly stroking her stomach. Celeste kept her eyes closed for a long while and Ryan thought that she had fallen asleep. But she opened them slowly looking at him and she smiled a little shyly as she said, "that was nice. . ."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan ran a hand through the hair on her forehead pushing it back as he kissed her forehead, then her nose, and the her lips lightly a few times. "I'm glad that you enjoyed it."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste smiled and closed her eyes again as she relaxed and she said softly, "I don't guess every girl my age is ready for something like that."
    </p>
    <p>
    "Nope. Not every girl your age would undress for a guy my age either though. It doesn't mean that other girls your age can't have older boyfriends."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste's sky blue eyes looked at him and she said, "You mean cause its not really about this stuff right?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan nodded, "exactly. Its developed into this stuff with us because of how intense we feel for each other." He paused before admitting the truth, "When you walk into a room its like time stops and everything else disappears for me Celeste. The moment I met you. . ."
    </p>
    <p>
    She blushed, "I felt it too. . .I feel it even now, I feel it even though I don't understand it."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan stroked one of her cheeks, "no one really understands love my little one. It just is what it is. You love your mom and dad right?"
    </p>
    <p>
    She nodded, "Yeah but not like this. . .this is different, its not like that kind of love."
    </p>
    <p>
    "Can you explain what it is that I make you feel?"
    </p>
    <p>
    She put her hand on his and said, "You make me feel safe, like when I'm with you nothing will harm me. I. . .I know that I could lay like this and you would never touch me unless I asked you to."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan smiled and kissed her lips again lightly as he said, "I will never do anything that you aren't ready for Celeste. Right now you are the single most important person in my life." She blushed and then rolled so that they were laying both on their sides facing each other. He rested a hand on her waist rubbing it softly and then he rolled onto his back so she could snuggle with him. She laid halfway on her side but flat enough against him that he could actually make out her perfect little bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
    He could tell that she was drifting off into sleep as she said, "do you really think that my body is beautiful?"
    </p>
    <p>
    "Yes, but it is you that makes it beautiful. Don't ever let any guy that just sees your outside beauty take advantage of you Celeste. You are beautiful on the outside, but it's the inside that anyone would gladly want to know more. If any guy ever just sees your outside beauty don't give him what he wants, no matter what his age is. . .because in the long run he will just hurt you."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste yawned and stroked his stomach as she said, "I know what you see more than anything. . .you see me. . .all of me."
    </p>
    <p>
    "That's right."
    </p>
    <p>
    She giggled slightly and in a tired almost asleep voice she said, "one day I might want to see all of you too. . ." He knew she meant his outside not his inside. She had already seen all of his inside. Sometimes it amazed him that she would listen to him talk about the stupidest things and never did she complain. He spent an entire afternoon one time explaining how a role playing game worked and why he had played them in high school. She had enjoyed listening it seemed, or perhaps it had just been that she was learning about him. She wanted to know him as much as he wanted to know her. She loved how he treated her like an equal and she wanted their relationship to be two-sided, real. He did as well. It might not last forever, but while it lasted it would be the most amazing thing that had ever happened in his life. He just hoped that when Celeste was his age or close to his age that she would look back on it and realize just how special it really was to her as well. . .

    </p>
    <p>
    It was so quiet it was almost maddening. For months he had been use to the sounds of Celeste running around, use to here being there in the afternoons, and now for the past two weeks she had been nowhere around. It wasn't like she had run away and hid from him, it wasn't like her mom was keeping her from him either. Celeste simply wasn't around because she wasn't home. Helen had gone up north to see her sisters. She had done this because Celeste had gone to spend the first month of the summer with her dad. Ryan missed her, greatly. There had been a few e-mails but not many mainly because she was very busy. Everyday her dad had planned something for them to do and every day was filled with fun for her. She was being a little girl and he wondered if she missed him?
    </p>
    <p>
    Did she ache to see him again like he ached to see her again? Did she think about him at all while she was out having fun? She was only nine years old! A nine year old could easily just go out and play and forget about the more serious things, even if they were waiting for her when she got back from play. Ryan filled his days with work, he got more work done in the month than he had gotten done in the months before it. He had of course given his employee's more work to do than they were use to as well. Perhaps he was too focused on work, trying to keep his mind off of Celeste and how much he was missing her, but he couldn't help it. Work was all he had to bury himself in without her there.
    </p>
    <p>
    HE was use to her being there in the afternoons. Use to the sound of her voice, the touch of her against him. Use to the hugs, the soft caresses. He had grown use to Celeste in his life, and there was no replacing who she was to him. No replacing what she meant to him. It was late in June on a Saturday afternoon and Ryan literally had no work to do so he was checking his e-mail and some websites when there was a knock at his apartment door. He sighed and got up walking to the door. He didn't look through the peephole though he should have.
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan opened the door and before he could even ask who it was someone had wrapped herself around him in a hug. She held tightly onto him and giggled a little before breaking back. She was so beautiful, he couldn't stop believing that she was there. She smiled up at him and then hugged him again and giggled some more. Her hair was slightly shorter, but not in a bad way. It had a definite cut to it that had been used to get rid of the split ends. Her light blue eyes sparkled and she was slightly tanned though not darkly tanned. She wore a half top shirt that showed off most of her stomach and a pair of really short and tight shorts.
    </p>
    <p>
    He smiled and said, "Hello there." Celeste just giggled again and hugged him again as she did he put a hand on her back rubbing it and looked up. For the first time he met her dad. James Appletree was not a tall man, he was slightly shorter than Ryan himself, and he had a little bit more weight to him than Ryan. He was a good looking man though. Ryan put his hand out and said, "I'm Ryan Sandleton."
    </p>
    <p>
    James took his hand shaking it and said, "I sort of gathered as much. A day hardly went by when she didn't make some comment about you. At some point she would always say: I wonder what Ryan is doing!" He chuckled and said, "She really must like you. Now I can understand why her mom told me to just leave her with you for tonight until she gets home tomorrow."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste walked around Ryan heading into his apartment as if she lived there. He supposed that she basically did. He smiled and said, "Your daughter is a great girl. So Helen's not going to be home until tomorrow?"
    </p>
    <p>
    James nodded, "exactly. Its okay if you watch her for the night? Helen was pretty angry with me for brining her back a day early, but Lindsey really wants to take our kids to see her parents before they head off to Germany." He looked down at his watch and Ryan got the horrible impression that it hadn't been time spent with her dad the entire month. That most of the time she had spent at her dad's had probably been with her little brothers. He had learned from Celeste that she had two little brothers.
    </p>
    <p>
    HE decided the best thing for him to do especially since Celeste didn't even want say goodbye to her dad. "Its fine Mr. Appletree really. I can watch Celeste for you."
    </p>
    <p>
    James Appletree nodded and said, "Goodbye Celeste, call me soon okay, I love you!" He said it across the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste peaked her head out of Ryan's bedroom and said, "Bye daddy." Then she put her head back inside. James handed him the bag of her clothes and a few seconds later Ryan closed the door to his apartment on James's retreating back. He shook his head not believing what he had just witnessed. He had never known what the relationship was between Celeste and her father, and he could tell that it was one that was just widening in rift. A gap that would one day not be bridged.
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste walked out of the bedroom and up to him. She looked up at him and Ryan smiled down at her and then before he could even speak or say anything he was hugging her in his arms holding her very closely to him. She felt so wonderful in his arms, so warm and soft. He stroked her back and said, "How are you feeling?" He knew that her feelings were not in a good place. She was happy to see him, but she wanted to get something off of her chest and he was the one that was there for her to let loose of these emotions she was keeping inside of her.
    </p>
    <p>
    Her light blue eyes met his as she put her hands on his face making his eyes look into her. Then she leaned over and kissed him on the lips a few times keeping eye contact as she said, "I missed you!" Then she was hugging him again just holding onto him. Suddenly there were tears and he could hear her crying.
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan let her cry for a long while as she finished he pulled her back and looked her in the eyes. He wiped under her eyes wiping away the tears and said, "Do you want to talk about it?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste nodded and took his hand leading him to the couch. He sat down and she sat on his lap sideways resting her head on his shoulder as she said, "I tried to have fun. . .really I did. I wanted to talk to you so badly. I missed you sooooooooo much!"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan smiled at her expression and stroked her back as he rested his other hand on her leg and said, "That's not what you wanted to tell me."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste looked away and said, "I know. . .it felt so weird being there. Like they didn't want me there. I wish I could have stayed here with you or even gone with my mom to my Aunts. My little brothers are brats and I don't like my step-mom. My dad was hardly if ever home and when he was. . .it was like I wasn't even there." She sniffed a little and continued, "I. . .I couldn't sleep with the light off up there."
    </p>
    <p>
    He softly stroked her back as he said, "that's okay Celeste."
    </p>
    <p>
    "I wanted you to hold me and play games with me like we do here. I was so lost up there without you and my mom."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan hugged her against him and said, "well I missed you too Celeste, my little one. It was very lonely here without you." Celeste just leaned in against him and the two of them stayed like that holding one another. HE stroked her slightly tanned leg feeling the smooth soft skin as he said, "did you at least have some fun?"
    </p>
    <p>
    She giggled a little and said, "Yeah I had some fun. But it would have been better if you had been there with me."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan dug a finger into her side and made her giggle loudly as her giggles passed he said, "I missed the sound of those giggles." He kissed her nose and said, "I love you Celeste."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste hugged him suddenly and rested her head against his shoulder as she said, "I love you too. I don't understand what it all means. I would lay in bed while I was gone and I would miss you. . .these feelings they confuse me and while they confuse me they also feel so good and wonderful. . ."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan smiled softly stroking one of her cheeks with the hand that had been on her leg and said, "You can talk to me about them as long as you want to."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste moved so that she was facing him and looking up at him slightly and said, "I want to try something."
    </p>
    <p>
    "Try something?" She nodded and he smiled for a second before she leaned over and kissed his lips. Their lips just touched lightly and then just as he was about to say something she leaned over again and this time her tongue was there. He could feel it, her ever so tiny tongue was touching his lips. Ryan responded as he naturally was intended to so. He opened his mouth and let her tongue slip in. A nine year old was frenching him. And not just any nine year old: Celeste Appletree. He put a hand down on her back and rubbed it as her tongue pushed into his mouth. It was doing a little darting in his mouth as if she was uncertain about what she was doing. Gently as he ran a hand through her hair Ryan let his tongue touch hers.
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste seemed a little uncertain for a second but then her tongue touched his again. She was exploring this for the first time, and with an older man. Ryan couldn't help it, as he kissed Celeste part of his own desires sneaked out, his penis became hard pressing against his pants and he knew because of the way she was sitting with her crotch right against his that she could feel it. Finally she pulled back and rested her head on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
    Despite the fact that she moved a little bit rubbing her crotch against his at this moment she said nothing about his erection. She leaned against him like this though for a long time and as she leaned against him stroked his back running his hand up under her shirt well aware that she wanted this intimate contact. He couldn't figure out how but as they had become more intimate with one another he could sense what she needed. What kind of contact she wanted from him.
    </p>
    <p>
    After a while he said, "Well little lady you better get up so I can go fix us some dinner." Celeste slipped off of his lap and rolled sitting down on the couch next to him as he stood up. As he started to walk towards the kitchen Celeste smacked him on the bottom and he said, "What was that for?"
    </p>
    <p>
    She just giggled and said, "Affection?" He just chuckled remembering when he had pulled the same thing on her and then headed into the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
    "Well since this is your first official day back home how about spaghetti?" Celeste agreed pretty quickly and even got up to follow him into the kitchen. She was very helpful getting things ready and a very beautiful sight as well. He kept staring at her bottom in the tight shorts she was wearing every time that she went to get something for him. Finally he had to shake his head to clear it from the thoughts he was having. The main one was: I just want to squeeze that little butt. He pushed it away but he noticed at one point when she came back into the kitchen she stared at him strangely, almost as if she had known he was looking at her bottom. Perhaps she did know?
    </p>
    <p>
    They ate together across from one another and Celeste kept staring at him as if she had something on her mind. He cleared the table after they finished eating and Celeste went to go take a shower. After putting the dishes in the dishwasher he went and took his own shower. When he came out of the bathroom in his boxers with briefs under them to keep his erection contained a little and hidden slightly from Celeste he found her sitting on the bed. Ryan wasn't going to argue with her about him sleeping somewhere else. He knew it would be fruitless. Celeste had on a long night shirt that went to about the middle of her thighs.
    </p>
    <p>
    She smiled and he finally decided that he had to know exactly what it was she had been thinking about for the past few hours. He sat down beside her on the bed and said, "So when are you going to tell me what you're keeping so quiet about?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste looked up at him and then resting her head against his shoulder she said, "I've just been thinking about something's. I've noticed something. . .and I don't know how to ask you about it."
    </p>
    <p>
    "You can ask me anything Celeste, I will try my best to answer it as truthfully as I can." He could see the uncertainty in her eyes as she looked up at him.
    </p>
    <p>
    Yet that didn't stop her from asking him, "I've noticed that you like looking at me. . .like how some of the boys in my class liked looking at one of our teachers. . .I mean I knew that you. . .that you liked me but I never really thought about it not like I did tonight. You. . .you get stiff when you look at me right?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan swallowed and said, "Stiff?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste nodded, "that's what my mom called it, when she told me about sex." Here she blushed and looked down as she said, "I felt it when we kissed earlier."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan put his arm around her shoulders and said, "You don't have to worry about that Celeste. . ."
    </p>
    <p>
    She shook her head and suddenly slipped off of the bed standing in front of him. She was so tiny looking in that large shirt yet he knew that she wasn't tiny. "Does looking at me make you stiff?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan knew that the truth was the only way that he could handle this question. He reached out taking one of her hands in his bringing her closer to him. She stood there looking into his eyes with her large light blue ones and as he stroked one of her cheeks he admitted to his little lover the full truth, "yes at times it does. I love looking at you Celeste. I didn't tell you how deep my physical attraction went, because I didn't know if you wanted to know or not."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste walked over to where he was climbing up onto his lap facing him as she did she said, "Did I kiss good, earlier?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan ran a hand through her mostly dry hair, "yes you were wonderful."
    </p>
    <p>
    She rested herself against him and despite his better judgment Ryan's penis began to harden. She blushed as she said, "I was scared."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan stroked her cheek softly as he said, "Why were you scared?"
    </p>
    <p>
    She shrugged and said, "Scared that I'd get it wrong. When we were kissing like that it was like when you touch me. I felt like I was floating and then I felt it. . .I mean. . ." She blushed a deeper read her cheeks going a little bit more crimson as she finished her thought. "I've felt it before but it was the first time I really got an idea in what you were getting out of all of this. I want you to feel good too!"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan lightly kissed her nose, "I feel good when you feel good Celeste."
    </p>
    <p>
    The nine year old shook her head, "I know there is more to it than just you touching me. . .I. . .I figure that I can touch you too."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan swallowed and said, "You can, but its not something that you have to do. . ."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste looked down between them and in a very quiet, but serious voice she said, "I think I want to see it." Then she looked up at him and said, "And if I change my mind I know you'll stop."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan stroked her cheek again, "this won't go any further than you want it to go Celeste. IF you're sure though I will let you see it. We've gone this far, entered this deeply into all of this with one another. I can see no reason why I can't show you me as well."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste nodded and slipped off of his lap standing there before him. Ryan thought about moving, about standing up so she could better see it but he changed his mind and instead took hold of both his boxers and his briefs and pulled. Letting his six inches out was like a relief that he had not expected. His penis stood straight up between his legs throbbing and his balls were completely visible as well. The head was covered by a little bit of skin as he was uncircumcised. Celeste stood there about a foot away and stared. Her eyes were huge as she looked. Ryan had to remind himself that this was the first time for nine year old Celeste to ever have seen a penis.
    </p>
    <p>
    She looked up slowly at his face and then with a blush to her cheeks she said, "It doesn't look scary. . .why is it something that so many say I shouldn't look at?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan sighed again this came back to the problems he had with the way that modern society treated children. They were treated as if they were supposed to be ignorant to the most basic of all human emotions. An emotion that this child standing before him clearly wanted to, and needed to understand. "Why do you think that people tell you it is wrong Celeste?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Her eyes clearly had stayed on it. She was fascinated by his penis, which was not too surprising. She was nine years old and she had never seen one. She was curious and this one wasn't going anywhere. The man that was showing it to her was also not going to reach over and force her to do something she didn't want to do. She surprised him by answering him, "Because you might try to hurt me or make me do something I don't want to do."
    </p>
    <p>
    "What do you think?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste walked closer, so that she was almost standing where he could fully embrace her again and she answered him. "I think its big, but there's not anything scary about it. Its not like you're making me touch it. What does it feel like?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Her eyes were still on it but Ryan knew that she would pay attention to his answer. "Well it feels hard. I can feel it moving and the stiffness of it, its really difficult to explain."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste nodded, seeming to think this over and said, "Can I feel what it feels like?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan nodded, "If you want to Celeste I won't stop you." The nine year old looked up at his face and then down at his erection again before finally reaching out very slowly. One of her fingers pressed against the head pushing it up against his stomach and when she did this she seemed to get an idea. She wrapped her fingers around his erection slowly getting a good feel for it. She squeezed a few times and he gave a sharp intake of breath.
    </p>
    <p>
    "It doesn't feel like how I thought it would feel. I thought it was going to be hard. . .but I can squeeze it." Ryan nodded and Celeste turned her head sideways as she said, "What is the white stuff coming out of the top?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan swallowed and said, "its basically semen, or the stuff that makes babies. When you get all of those good feelings inside of you, have you ever noticed how you have a wet feeling between your legs?" She nodded and he said, "Well when I get those good feelings a whole bunch of semen comes out of my penis its what makes babies when its put inside of a girl."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste thought about this for a minute and then said, "I want to see that. . .see what it looks like I mean when you feel good."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan smiled gently stroking one of her cheeks as he said, "if you're sure I can show you how to make it happen." Celeste nodded her head and started to move her hand away but Ryan took her hand softly stroking it as he put it back around his erection. The feel of having her small hand wrapped around him, and his own hand wrapped around hers was amazing. Softly as he showed her how to move her hand he said, "If you don't feel comfortable about any of this. . ."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste just nodded her head and said, "It feels different, but not in a bad way. I know that girlfriends do things like this for their boyfriends."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan could feel his need already building and knew that he was not going to last much longer so he strained and said, "Where did you learn that?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste shrugged, "online, an older girl was talking about it with another girl and I read what they were saying. I don't think they were talking about an older guy. But it still made me wonder if you wanted something like this."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan swallowed and said, "if you. . ."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste shook her head, "I wanted to." Then she started to stroke him again like he had shown her. Ryan could feel it he was getting very close to cuming now, his entire body could feel the effect her tiny hand was having on him.
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan swallowed and as he tried to catch his breath he said, "its going to happen really soon now Celeste." She just nodded and her eyes never left his erection. Ryan couldn't believe that this was happening. A nine year old girl was jerking him off. No his nine year old girlfriend was jerking him off. His lovely, beautiful Celeste. She was standing there in front of him in a tee-shirt and a pair of panties nothing else, her hair freshly combed with her hand wrapped around his penis. She was. . .oh that was it. HE grunted and said, "Oh baby. . ." Then his penis jerked and his seed started spilling out. Celeste just watched her eyes focused on his erection as he came. More of his seed spilled out until finally it ended.
    </p>
    <p>
    She had not moved her hand off of his erection and she was still holding it despite the fact that his cum had rolled all over her fingers. As he started to soften a little Celeste removed her hand from his erection and looked up at him. Then she looked down at her fingers and looked at the liquidly cum that was on her fingers. She brought it up to her face being curious about it and sniffed before tasting with her tongue once. Ryan handed her a shirt from the floor and Celeste wiped her hand off before looking up at him.
    </p>
    <p>
    He smiled and drew her close to him holding her softly against him as he said, "well?"
    </p>
    <p>
    She leaned up and kissed him on the lips before climbing up into the bed. He followed her after putting his boxers back on, but no briefs this time. He laid down and she cuddled up next to him resting her head on his stomach. Already he was hardening again and she said softly, "your penis wants me to play with it again."
    </p>
    <p>

    Ryan chuckled, "yah I suppose it does but don't worry about that okay sweetie?" Celeste nodded and he reached over turning the light off and then he laid there with her in the dark. He stroked her back running his hand through her hair as he said, "Are you really okay sweetie?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste moved her head until her face was inches away from his own and she leaned down and lightly kissed his lips a few times before laying back down again. The soft feel of her in his arms was wonderful, as had the soft texture of her lips on his been just as wonderful. "I wanted to do it. . .do you believe me?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan smiled, "I believe you Celeste. Its just nice to hear it from you." He kissed the top of her head and said, "I love you my darling little one."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste giggled a little but he could tell she was already drifting off into sleep when she said, "I love you too Ryan. . .with all my heart. . ." Then she was drifting away into sleep. Ryan found himself following her pretty quickly. . .

    <p>
    Not all of the summer was spent with just the two of them. Celeste was ultimately a nine year old girl and she had to still be a nine year old girl. While he watched her during the days sometimes, other times she went and stayed with her best friend Amanda and Amanda's little sister. Ryan picked her up a few times over the summer months from Amanda's and found both Amanda and Stacey her little sister to be very cute girls that he did have a few fantasies about. Nothing as intense as the dreams that he was almost constantly having about Celeste now.
    </p>
    <p>
    Amanda stayed the night with Celeste a few times too and the two girls actually spent a couple of days with him, just the three of them. The water park was a lot of fun, just twenty-six year old Ryan and two nine year old girls both in two piece bathing suits. Of which they both seemed to enjoy teasing him and getting him to pay attention to them. Amanda was a joy to be around, but not the same kind of joy that Celeste was. If Amanda thought it was strange how much Celeste hugged him, or let him hug her she said nothing about it. If she thought it was strange that Celeste and him kissed on the lips one time she said nothing about it. No cops appeared at his door either so he figured that Celeste had told her friend to say nothing about it.
    </p>
    <p>
    School started back the last week of August and again after having Celeste in his company most days of the summer it felt lonely not having her in the apartment. He was helping Celeste's mom find a house for the two of them so that they could move out and back into a house by the end of the year. That would be even harder for Ryan because she would be moving a little further away from him once again. Yet if their relationship was meant to endure it would. That first afternoon when school let out he drove up to the elementary school and Celeste climbed into the car.
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste smiled and he smiled and said, "So how was your first day of fourth grade?"
    </p>
    <p>
    She shrugged her shoulders and said, "about so-so, what about you?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan chuckled, "I'm not in the fourth grade. . .but I did miss you terribly."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste giggled a little and leaned over to hug him. Ryan hugged her back and then put the car into drive and headed home. Celeste was dressed in a pair of blue-jeans that hugged to her prepubescent curves, and a long sleeved purple shirt that hugged her flat chest and stomach as well. It was strange but he knew that at least partly she had picked this shirt out because of him and also because of her love of the color. He watched her sitting on the floor writing an essay about what she did over the summer and marveled at how beautiful she was.
    </p>
    <p>
    She was tiny, this he had already known, but it was the strength he saw in her skinny frame that leant to such greatness. Her sandy blonde hair fell in such a way that it partially hid her face, but it also leant a certain kind of beauty to her. She was chewing on the end of her pen as she thought about what she was going to say and then as if sensing that he was watching her she turned her eyes up to look at him and said, "how do you spell disaster?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan smiled and spelled the word for her, "D-i-s-a-s-t-e-r."
    </p>
    <p>
    "Thanks!" Then she went right back to working on her essay. She finished a few minutes later and again looked over at him as if sensing that he was still looking at her. A blush filled her cheeks for a second as if she had just become aware of why he was looking at her and she stood up with the essay in her hand and said, "You want to read it?" Ryan took the essay and read it over to make sure that she hadn't made any huge mistakes. There was a part of the essay where she was talking about spending time with him and Amanda, and she had written just once sentence that he knew he would hold in his heart forever: I love Ryan, he's older than me but he understands me and pays real attention to me, and I know that he loves me too. Then it went on to talk about how the three of them (Amanda included) had gone to the water park. The end was sweet as well: If not for Ryan and Amanda my summer would have been a disaster but they saved my summer that's what true friends are for.
    </p>
    <p>
    She had a definite way with words. He handed her the paper back and said, "its very good." Celeste put the paper away in her notebook and then after putting the notebook back in her backpack she walked over to where hew as and just looked up at him. Ryan couldn't help but look into her sky blue eyes as he did she smiled and took his hand walking with him over to the couch. She didn't say anything she just sort of gestured and he smiled before sitting down on the couch. He was not surprised when she slipped up onto his lap facing him. Lately this had become where she liked to spend their quiet time together.
    </p>
    <p>
    He didn't need her permission anymore to rest one of his hands on her leg and softly rub it through the jeans. Their relationship had grown beyond that. He knew what Celeste wanted and he knew why she wanted it. Like any other person in the world nine year old Celeste Appletree wanted to feel love, to know love, to be loved. It was the most basic, most natural human need, and he knew without a doubt that this nine year old loved him as deeply as he loved her.
    </p>
    <p>
    She leaned over and put her lips to his lightly. She tested the kiss a few times before pressing her tongue against his lips. Ryan let her in, and again he found himself drifting in thought of how wonderful Celeste was as he kissed her. Their kiss did not end any time soon. Celeste would break apart every few seconds but then she would be right back in kissing. Her lips felt so good against this, her tongue was like a cube of sugar that he just couldn't stop tasting. Over and over again she would dip her tongue into his mouth and as she did he ran his hand down her back feeling her spine.
    </p>
    <p>
    The kiss became more intense especially on her end as she had now pressed herself against him. Her crotch was pressing against him, he could feel the zipper of his jeans digging in to his erection slightly but the feeling of her pressing against him was amazing. Sometimes Celeste just got into these kinds of moods and Ryan took them as they came. His hand was now under her shirt rubbing her back as she moaned and breathing heavily finally broke their kiss. They sat like that her head on his shoulder, his hand stroking her back and one of her legs for a long while. They talked quietly as they sat like that. He asked her questions about school, how her friends were. She asked him about other adult things besides sex and he answered her questions as best as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
    That was how their weeks went that first month, then came a Saturday where her mom had to work during the day. Ryan found himself alone with Celeste again. They were playing cards, which wasn't too hard to believe, and she was actually pretty good at it. Her mom had decided to let Celeste stay the night with him even though she was going to be home later that night. Ryan figured that the main reason for this was that Celeste had asked her mom if she could stay over at Ryan's house.
    </p>
    <p>
    It was strange, Helen knew that her daughter was being intimate with a grown man, but she didn't stop it. In fact she almost seemed to encourage the time that they spent together. Perhaps Helen knew that he would be good for her daughter's future. He was clearing the table from the card game while Celeste went and took a shower. As he was finishing clearing the table she came out of the shower and shocked him when he looked over at her.
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste had emerged clean and freshly showered, but she was dressed in only a pair of plain cotton blue panties. She smiled and he couldn't help but look at her. HE could see her pink nipples as they hardened from the cold of the room. He marveled at the beauty of her freshly bathed body. She smiled at him and walked right past him towards the bedroom. Ryan turned to look at her, god her tight little bottom looked so wonderful in those panties! He was hard in a matter of seconds hardly believing what he had just seen.
    </p>
    <p>
    He turned off the last of the lights in the kitchen and walked into the bedroom. She was sitting on the bed with her back resting against the headrest. When he walked in she looked at him and blushed as she said, "I. . .I forgot my nightshirt."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan chuckled, "Do you want me to go get it?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste shook her head and said, "no. . .I. . .I want you to make me feel good again." She hadn't asked him to touch her in nearly two weeks, and now suddenly out of the blue she was asking. That he supposed was how it went. Again it was about her, not about him. He had desired greatly to touch her again. He could have done it every day, put his hands on her little cunny. . .kissed her. For her it had to be something else. Something had to trigger it inside of her he supposed. She was a little girl after all, a beautiful, sexy and intelligent little girl. She saw sex differently than he did, and he had to learn to accept that. This wasn't about him it was about her.
    </p>
    <p>
    It might have been about her not about him, but that didn't mean that she would be unwilling to let him try something else. He smiled and said, "You want me to make you feel good again?" Celeste nodded and Ryan pulled his shirt off along with his jeans before climbing into the bed with her. He saw her eyes go to his erection still hidden by his boxers for a second but she didn't say anything about it. She had grown accustomed to him getting hard around her. She had accepted it as a part of him admiring her beauty. She had even asked him if she got other men hard and he had told her that yes she probably did. SHE had accepted that as well. It had not ruined her childhood, she was still every bit of a child as she had been before this relationship had begun.
    </p>
    <p>
    "I want to try something new Celeste, if you'll let me."
    </p>
    <p>
    She looked at him and then down between his legs for a second and she said, "I'm not ready for that. . ."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan stroked one of her cheeks, "No not that sweetie. I want to try and use my tongue down on your cunny."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste looked down at her panties and said, "You want to put your mouth on my cunny? I pee out of there!"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan smiled and said, "I know you do sweetheart but that doesn't mean that I don't want to try it. Just promise me you won't pee and I'll try it if you'll let me."
    </p>
    <p>
    She seemed to think about this for a minute before she said, "will it feel as good as when your hand touches me down there?"
    </p>
    <p>
    "Better."
    </p>
    <p>
    "Okay. . .but if I don't like it. . ."
    </p>
    <p>
    "I will stop." She nodded and Ryan kissed her nose lightly once as he said, "lay down for me okay sweetie." She nodded and laid down fully on the bed. He laid down beside her putting his hand on her stomach and softly rubbing it as he said, "I'm going to go really slowly okay, so that if you don't like any of it you just tell me and I will stop." She nodded again and he gently leaned down and kissed her lips. At first she seemed nervous, as her tongue played with his he could feel her nerves starting to slip away. His hand moved down rubbing over one of her legs and Ryan again marveled at how tiny Celeste was, at how small she felt under his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
    He broke their kiss gently as he used his lips to kiss the side of her neck slowly raining kisses down her neck before running them over her left collarbone. Then he picked up her hand and lightly sucked on each one of her fingers making Celeste giggle a little. When he leaned over a little more and flicked his tongue against one of her erect pink nipples the giggles stopped suddenly and became a small gasp of surprised pleasure. Her little body was definitely responding to his light touches, as it always had before.
    </p>
    <p>
    He flicked his tongue over the nipple once more and then latched his lips onto it lightly applying pressure. As eh did this Celeste seemed to respond by taking in a whole lot of air. As he moved his mouth off of the nipple she let the air out. He looked up at her and noticed that her cheeks were filled with a blush. She smiled and he went back down again. He flicked his tongue across her other nipple and as he did his hand ran up and over her panties. He could feel the lips of her cunny under the panties and as he rubbed them and put his lips to her nipple Celeste cried out. Her cries had become second nature to him, they were something that he knew he would hear each time he touched her. For each time she had let him touch her she had cried out just like this.
    </p>
    <p>
    He moved off of her other nipple licking around it a few times with his tongue before moving downwards. He ran his hand up tracing over her ribs lightly as his mouth moved down. He had never dreamed he would be touching a prepubescent girl in such a way, yet he was. She breathed in heavily as he moved down lower. Her trace a circle around her belly button before blowing a raspberry. The raspberry took her totally off guard and Celeste just started to giggle as he took hold of her panties.
    </p>
    <p>
    Ever so slowly Ryan removed Celeste's panties. He was teasing himself and her as well as he slowly pulled them down revealing more of her stomach and then finally those two little lips that signaled her cunny. He smiled up at her and then continued pulling her panties off of her skinny child legs. He tossed the panties to the floor and gently rubbed her feet. She was here with him, in this intimate bed. He could have a dozen times before now taken advantage of her, and of her trust in him. He could have taken her by force, made her his, even made her think she wanted it.
    </p>
    <p>
    Instead he had done what anyone who truly loved anyone else would have done. He had let her discover for herself what she wanted, and she had found him through it all. Now she was about to let him be far more intimate with her than he had ever thought he would achieve. One day even he might be the one to take her virginity. He leaned down as his hand spread her legs and he licked at one of her thighs. Celeste giggled at the tickling sensation that his tongue produced but he could tell by the glistening wetness on her cunny that she did not want him to stop.
    </p>
    <p>
    He licked at her inner thighs and as he did he took in her scent. It was sweet and filled his entire head. He could feel his penis throbbing with his need, he was so close to loosing himself as he came closer to her cunny. He kissed right above where the lips began, so perfect was her little cunny, so unlike that of an adult woman's. He kissed the top of the lips and Celeste's eyes opened wider as he ran kisses along the lips. Ryan could taste her juices, she was so tasteful that he couldn't stop himself.
    </p>
    <p>
    His tongue ran along the outer lips a few times and Celeste groaned as she began to respond to his ministrations. He licked at the lips pressing his tongue between them and as he did Celeste groaned loudly with an, "OHHHHH!" Filling the room. He pushed his tongue between the lips and found her little clit flicking his tongue against it and as he did she pushed her cunny up against this mouth. Her body was building to pleasure quickly now, nine year old Celeste was about to cum again for her lover. Ryan spread her cunny with his fingers and pushed his tongue against her clit again this time driving it against the hard little bump. Celeste cried out, "OHHHHHH!" Her body shuddered and Ryan clamped his tongue down on her clit sucking hard on it. Over and over again she shuddered and he found himself abandoning her clit as he began to lick at her juices.
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste finally finished cuming, falling back to the bed she softly gave one last little gasp and Ryan finished licking up her juices leaving only his saliva behind. He looked up at her from where his head was between her spread nine year old legs and putting his hands on the legs to stroke them and squeeze them he leaned over and lightly kissed her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
    Then he fell down on the bed beside her. They laid like that both of them on their backs for a while. Celeste's breathing slowed and she turned onto her side putting her head on his chest. This was where she loved to lay her head and when he felt her leg wrap around his own he pulled at the blankets putting them over both of them. He turned the light out and held her close to him rubbing her back. Quietly Celeste said, "I thought that was going to be yucky or something. . .but. ..It felt sooooooo good!"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan smiled and said, "That's how its supposed to feel." Sometimes he felt so guilty about teaching this little girl about sex. Yet he knew that was society's stigma put on him. Society had said for so long that it was wrong for a girl of Celeste's age to enjoy or even want sex that he expected society to be right. He should have known that society was wrong. He should have known that some little girls did want to learn about sex. Especially when they were in the kind of relationship that he had entered into with Celeste.
    </p>
    <p>
    Quietly as she laid there against him Celeste said, "I wish sometimes that I could tell Amanda about all of this."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan's heart went out to Celeste, it ached for her. He stroked her back and said, "I know you do sweetheart."
    </p>
    <p>
    "I will tell her one day, when both me and her are grown up and when no one can do anything to you."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan stroked her back and said, "I love you Celeste."
    </p>
    <p>
    She smiled he could feel it and she snuggled in closer and said, "I think every girl should have a boyfriend like you Ryan." His heart ached as she drifted off into sleep in his arms. HE agreed with her, every girl her age should have a special boyfriend. Too bad society only saw with its eyes blinded to the truths that stared right in front of it. . .

    </p>
    <p>
    Halloween, was a holiday that Ryan often had imagined was designed for little girl lovers in particular. Or perhaps just lovers of children. It was that one day of the year that both children and adults got to act as if they had not a single care in the world which was very far from the truth for both. It was that one holiday where everyone got to dress up and for one night you could pretend to be someone else. Ryan had agreed with Helen that he would take Celeste, her best friend Amanda, and Amanda's little sister Stacy all trick-or-treating. He hadn't expected for his little vixen to wear such a beautiful outfit though.
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste had picked it out herself with her mom and had refused for nearly two weeks to tell Ryan what it was that she had chosen to be. When she knocked on the door to his apartment Ryan had planned on answering it with his false teeth in and asking Celeste if she wanted him to suck her blood. Yet all he got out of his mouth was, "do. . ." Celeste had died her hair (with her mom's permission) to a darker shade of brown and it had been frizzled, the nine year old literally looked like the spitting image of Hermione from the Harry Potter movies. She was shorter. . .but she still had the same image. She wore a Hogwarts cloak and of course a scarf from Gryffindor. Ryan could hardly believe how beautiful she looked.
    </p>
    <p>
    She looked up at him and said, "So what do you think?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan looked around and said, "I could suck all of your cute blood out of you right now. . ."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste giggled and said, "Come on! Amanda and Stacy are already waiting at Amanda's house!" So Ryan ended up spending the rest of the late afternoon walking around with Celeste, Amanda (who was dressed up like a fairy princess), and Stacy (who was dressed up like a cat girl). Ryan knew it though, Celeste had chosen the Hermione outfit because of him. She had chosen to make him look at her, not because he had coerced her and ruined her innocence, but because like any girl around her age she was started to understand the powers she held over men. Especially this one male in particular.
    </p>
    <p>
    They went from house to house, a strange troop of a Witch, a Princess, a Cat, and a Vampire. It was strange watching these three girls. Stacy, Amanda's little sister's cat suit was tight, and Ryan kept trying not to look at her bottom when the girls went up to another house, but couldn't help it. Celeste wore the knee high socks, the skirt, the vest, even the tie. . .all of the outfit. She looked like a miniature Hermione. There was no getting around it.
    </p>
    <p>
    Finally around eight in the evening Ryan called an end to their festivities and the four of them went back to Amanda's house. Amanda and her sister went in and Ryan talked with her parents for a little bit explaining how he knew Celeste and her mom. In the car ride home Celeste put her candy bag between her legs down on the floor and then put one of her hands in his. She fell asleep on the ride home. Ryan parked the car and walked around to her side gently he lifted her out and carried her up the walkway.
    </p>
    <p>
    She stirred a little bit but when she saw who it was that was carrying her, she just sort of snuggled up a little bit and went back to sleep. Ryan quietly knocked on her apartment's door and Helen opened it. He put the candy down on the coffee table and carried Celeste into her room. Gently he laid her down on her bed but Celeste did wake up this time. She took his hand pulling him down to her and she said in a quite and very sleepy voice, "stay. . ."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan couldn't believe this. He couldn't even think about it. Celeste's mom would throw a fit, especially since tomorrow was a school day. Ryan started to explain this to Celeste, but as he started to say something her mom said from the doorway, "its okay Ryan." That was it before she walked away. Sometimes Ryan could sense it in Helen. She feared for her daughter, for her entire family. Yet he also could see something else in Helen. She knew him for what he was, she knew how much he cared for her little girl. She knew and somehow knowing that he would take care of her little girl was enough for Helen to give in.
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan took off his false teeth and his cape before climbing into the bed with her. He had chosen not to put any make up on so that wasn't a problem. When he laid down in her small bed Celeste rolled over and immediately was in his arms He didn't argue with her and when he felt her hand undoing his shirt pulling it back so she could rest her hand there on his stomach he didn't argue again. For some reason Celeste like close physical contact and he wasn't one to tell her no. He stroked her hair and as he did she mumbled something softly and was out like a light.
    </p>
    <p>
    That night was one of the sweetest that he had ever had with young Celeste and it stuck in his mind for years after that. The months passed again. Thanksgiving was hard for him because Celeste went with her mom to spend it up north at her grandmother's house. Yet it was also nice to see that he did sort of have a life even without Celeste in it. Though he often found himself looking at her picture. Then Christmas came and Ryan spent weeks agonizing over what he should get Celeste. Finally he settled on a charm bracelet with the words: Love Always inscribed on it.
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste loved the bracelet and after giving it to her he never saw her take it off. . .not even during their times of loving one another. Oh and that did continue. It wasn't everyday, or even every week, but there were just certain days that Celeste would sit on his lap facing him and ask him politely: would you love me? Or would you touch me again? There were a few times as well during these weeks and months that she would touch him, but Ryan knew that she was still growing comfortable with that. He always used his mouth now, as it brought Celeste to even more intense orgasms.
    </p>
    <p>
    His one great desire to have her use her mouth on him had not happened yet and Ryan was pretty certain that it never would. HE wasn't going to ask her to do it, he wasn't going to make it seem as if he even needed it, yet he did want it. It was shortly after new years and only two months until Celeste's birthday at the end of March. She was getting older, for one thing she was taller, but she showed no signs of turning to a woman. For another she was smarter, more aware of the world around her and the things within it.
    </p>
    <p>
    She wanted to know about things that he had never thought he would have to answer. Yet he did and he found it hart warming that she came to him with these questions. He would talk with her for a long time about anything and often her mind was very insightful. She would often look at things in a very different way than an adult would and to Ryan that was the single most refreshing thing he had experienced in a long time. They talked, and together they learned more about one another. Celeste was growing more beautiful each day as well to Ryan's eyes. No longer was it just her outer beauty that totally transfixed him all of her inner beauty did as well. There was not a part of Celeste Appletree that he did not find appealing.
    </p>
    <p>
    If he could have, he would have walked her down the aisle that second and sealed the two of them together forever. Yet he knew that Celeste was nowhere near ready for marriage. He would wait, he could wait, he was prepared for it. Yet the possibilities remained strong that she would never marry him, that eventually she would need more than what he had to offer. It was hard on him and he tried to keep his thoughts about this hidden, but Celeste knew him every bit as well as he knew her.
    </p>
    <p>
    One Saturday afternoon early in the new year as he was working on a finalized report for his own boss Celeste knocked on his apartment door. Ryan answered the door a little surprised to see the young girl there. She was dressed in a pair of jeans and a long sleeved purple shirt that the sleeves seemed to big on. He smiled delighted to see her even though he hadn't expected her and said, "What are you doing here?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste smiled as well and said, "I came to see my boyfriend." Ryan just chuckled and held the door open so she could walk in. When he closed the door and turned around to look at her she was looking up at him. Her sandy blonde hair was pulled back in a ponytail and her sky blue eyes seemed to shine, but he could tell even before the words came out of her mouth that something was on her mind. "We need to talk about something."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan just nodded and gestured for the couch. He was a little surprised when Celeste didn't sit down on his lap but instead sat down beside him. He turned to look at her and said, "So what's on your mind little one?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste looked up at him and said, "Something's bothering you. I don't know how I know that, but I know that it is. I. . .I want you to tell me what it is."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan couldn't deny this little beauty anything, even something that might hurt her or him in the long run. He swallowed and answered her carefully. "I'm watching you grow up Celeste. . .and I know that eventually you'll want to grow up more and see other things, try other things. . .be with other people. . ."
    </p>
    <p>
    She looked over at him and then down at her hands, at the charm bracelet that he had given her and she said, "I love you Ryan."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan put his arm around her shoulders and said, "Listen okay Celeste, its my concern, my worry. Its not something you need to think about."
    </p>
    <p>
    She shook her head and rested it on his shoulder as she said, "I could promise to never break up with you?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan squeezed her shoulder, "you could but that's not a good idea sweetheart, not good for either us or our relationship with one another." Celeste nodded and with her head still resting there he reached down and lightly tickled her side as he said, "plus there is lots more fun things we can do!"
    </p>
    <p>
    Giggling slightly Celeste said, "Like what?"
    </p>
    <p>
    "Go ask your mom if you can go to the movies with me and we'll go see one okay?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste leaned over and kissed him lightly on the lips once as she said, "Only if I get to pick the movie and hold the popcorn this time!"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan tickled one of her sides and hugged her to him again smelling the scent of her as he said, "You can hold the popcorn all you want. . .but the film. . .I think I should pick that one."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste shook her head and said, "nu uh its my turn you picked the last one!"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan kissed her lips once lightly and said, "Okay you can pick the movie this time." A few minutes later they were on their way to the movies and both Ryan and Celeste forgot all about the dark thoughts that he had been having. Plus he got to see her in tight jeans throughout the day. They went to the mall after the movie and she kept walking in front of him while they walked through the mall, or she would keep moving away from him in stores making him look at her. She knew he was looking at her small perfectly rounded bottom, her long skinny legs, her wonderful flat chest and stomach. He knew that she was practicing her flirting with the one person in the world she trusted more than her own mother. The one person that had shown her as much love as her mother had shown her though a very different kind of love it was. . .
    </p>
    <p>
    They arrived back at the apartment kind of late and Celeste ran off to go get in the shower. Ryan watched her and found himself amazed again at how beautiful she was. For a considerable part of his life now he had known that he liked pre-teen girls well here was one that liked him back! He watched her and just chuckled to himself before he headed off to his own shower. She was still private about a few things and her showers were a big one. He had just finished taking his shower and drying himself when Celeste walked in.
    </p>
    <p>
    She was wearing only a pair of plain white panties but they looked very nice on her little pre-teen frame. She smiled at him and Ryan felt his penis starting to harden. Celeste looked down at where he was hardening and suddenly things seemed to change from a quite moment into something else. His beautiful girlfriend walked over to where he was and said, "I've been thinking. . .you can lick me right? So that means that I can lick you too. . ."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan swallowed and said, "Yes you can Celeste, but its not something that is required." His penis was throbbing now fully hard and Celeste had pressed up against him so that it was pressing against her stomach. He leaned down and lightly kissed her on the lips. Celeste responded back in kind and as he stroked her cheek she pulled back slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
    That was when she said, "I think I want to at least try it."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan took her hand in his and said, "If you want to try it then I will let you try it Celeste. We'll go in the bedroom." Celeste nodded and followed him into his bedroom. Ryan sat down on his bed and drew Celeste in so that she was standing between his legs. His young girlfriend was too tall to do it standing up even from the bed so Ryan said, "go ahead and get down on your knees. Now there is a trick to licking and sucking on a man's penis that is very different than how I do you." Celeste nodded her little hand circling around his hard on as he said, "You want to start just by licking it, get a taste for it, understand the texture of it and see if you like the licking."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste nodded and he could see the nervousness inside of her, yet he could also see her desire to make him feel as good as he made her feel. She leaned over and gently licked just really quickly over the head of his erection. Ryan gave a small sigh as she did this and Celeste looked up at him her sky blue eyes meeting his as she said, "Am I doing it right?" Ryan just nodded and ran a hand through her hair. Celeste smiled satisfied and then leaned over and licked again. This time she licked a little bit more than just the top of the head. Ryan was impressed she seemed to be learning quickly, then again she was a very smart girl.
    </p>
    <p>
    She licked down the entire length of his erection and Ryan could feel her tongue wetting his penis as he ran a hand through her hair again. She smiled looking up at him and Ryan said, "You're doing good sweetie."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste giggled a little and said, "its kinda like licking a Popsicle. . .can. ..Can I eat your cum with out it hurting me?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan could hardly believe that she wanted to suck him off, now she wanted to swallow him too. He supposed that made sense in a way. HE smiled and said, "yes sweetie you can eat it, my cum won't hurt you in fact it might fill your tummy up some." She giggled and blushed at that and he said, "You ready to try the real sucking on it?" Celeste nodded and Ryan said, "Okay sweetie what you have to do is really simple, you just open your mouth and very slowly take the head of my penis into it. Then you want to apply some pressure and also rub your tongue along it. Keep doing that while you take more of my erection into your mouth. Just take as much as you think you can, don't force too much in. Trust me even just an inch will be more than enough."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste nodded and then looked down at his erection. For a long while Ryan thought she was scared and he almost said something but then she just looked back up at him and said, "I. . .I love you Ryan and I want to show you like you show me!" Then she leaned over and put her lips to his erection. It as the single most incredible feeling of his life feeling that little mouth slowly starting to surround his erection. Slowly she took more of him in. Her little mouth seemed to surround the head pushing it in further and he could feel her little tongue as well. It rubbed along the bottom of his erection. Ryan gave a small sigh of satisfaction and stroked Celeste's hair as she applied a bit of pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
    She took a little bit more of his erection into her mouth and Ryan grunted as he felt her taking him in. He was getting close now, his penis was throbbing with his need and he wondered if Celeste could feel it or not. She took a little bit more and as she did Ryan said, "that's it little one. . .oh Celeste I've gotta cum now sweetie. . .I oh god I'm sorry." He pushed into his nine year old girlfriend's mouth and his penis jerked and the first load of his seed shot out. Celeste did not pull back like he had expected instead she just kept sucking on his erection. His first load shot out into her mouth and then another. Celeste tried to swallow it all but soon he was cuming far too much and far too quickly for her.
    </p>
    <p>
    She did not pull back and she did not complain. Finally he finished cuming and collapsed back on the bed breathing heavily. Celeste slowly removed him from her mouth and he sat up slowly looking at her. Some of his cum had dribbled down her chin and she was wiping at it now with a small towel as she stood in the bathroom doorway. Ryan sat up totally and as he did she walked over to him. He started to harden again despite the incredible blow job he had just received. Celeste looked down at his erection and said, "Ryan?"
    </p>
    <p>
    He reached out taking her hand and said, "Yeah sweetie?"
    </p>
    <p>
    "Just looking at me makes it get big doesn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan chuckled and said, "Yeah sometimes that's it all it takes little one." Celeste just smiled and Ryan pulled her up onto his lap and then scooted up onto the bed before laying down. They rearranged themselves until both of them were happy with her laying almost on top of him and as he stroked her back Ryan said, "I love you Celeste. You are the sunlight in my life."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste giggled and said, "It was fun!"
    </p>
    <p>
    "What was fun sweetie?"
    </p>
    <p>
    "When you came inside of my mouth, all that white stuff. It did taste like how I thought it was going to taste, it was kinda sweet. There was a lot of it but it was fun feeling it squirt into my mouth." She giggled again and stroked his chest hair as she said, "I love you too Ryan. . .I really really do." They drifted off to sleep shortly after that. Ryan had to admit he had met the most incredible nine year old girl in his life. What was funny was it wouldn't matter to him how old she got she would always be Celeste to him and he would always love her just as he did now. . .

    </p>
    <p>
    It was like any other ten year old girls birthday party Ryan was certain. There were two adults there to capture every moment on camera, and lots of presents. Friends were present as were the presents that they had brought. In fact it all appeared to be a little girl's birthday party because that was what it was. In private with Ryan she got to be a little older than she really was, but here in public she got to be who she was, Celeste. In private she showed a face that her friends perhaps were not ready to see, that of Celeste the lover. Yet at the same time Ryan knew that she had given him extra attention on this her special day. She was ten, no longer did she live life in the single digits now it would be double for the rest of her life.
    </p>
    <p>
    The friends were many, most of them she knew from school. The party was fun and full of interesting activities. Celeste enjoyed herself and opened every present she got, all but one that she wouldn't receive until Saturday. Three of her friends stayed the night that Friday and the next morning around ten a.m. they went home. Ryan was not privy to this as he had gone home Friday night alone, though he had the suspicion that he hadn't been totally alone. A part of Celeste seemed to go with him everywhere that he went now. She was always there in his heat somehow.
    </p>
    <p>
    He was working Saturday morning well aware that when Celeste knocked on his door that no work would get done. He had bought her a special gift much like the one he had given to her for Christmas. Celeste he had learned had a fascination with castles. Not storybook castles but real medieval castles. HE had bought a glass orb set on a pedestal that looked like a dragon's claw holding it and inside the orb was a real replica of a castle in Spain. He knew that Celeste would love it. It was a very intimate gift, something that a lover would give not something that a "friend" would give. He had known that right away and had known better than to let her open it in front of all of her friends. Too many variables there.
    </p>
    <p>
    He was about to open another file and start work on it when the knock came. Ryan smiled despite the work that he knew he had to do and walked to the door opening it. Celeste stood there in a dress. Her sandy blonde hair hung down the sides of her face, not pulled back for once. The dress she wore was loose hiding most of what made her body beautiful yet at the same time making it just as beautiful. She smiled up at him and he smiled down at her, sharing a secret between the two of them that he couldn't explain.
    </p>
    <p>
    She followed him into the apartment and said, "My mom told me to tell you thank you from her, for helping with the party."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan touched one of Celeste's shoulders rubbing it gently as he said, "it's the least I could do for the mother of my girlfriend."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste's cheeks turned red and she looked up at him as she said, "So what did I get?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan chuckled, "You didn't think that I would forget to get you something now did you?" He walked over to the counter and picked up the gift. She took it surprised by the weight and sat down on the couch as she opened it. When she got the box it was inside of open (after taking off the wrapping paper as well) she gently lifted it out and just stared. For a few seconds Ryan was scared that she didn't like it then she put it down gently on the table in front of her and came over to where he was hugging him fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan hugged her back and picked her up in his arms walking with her to the couch. She sat on his lap her legs on either side of his own her crotch almost pushed up against his own. Lightly they kissed, their lips touching softly a few times and as they kissed Celeste took one of his hands putting it on her leg. He took the hint and began to softly rub her leg. Ryan could feel his need growing, and he knew as he moved his hand up her leg that Celeste was growing in need as well.
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste pulled back breaking their kiss her tongue going back into her own mouth as his hand brushed against her panties. In a quite voice she said, "I've been thinking and I. . .I want to try it."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan swallowed not sure what she meant and said, "Try what sweetie?"
    </p>
    <p>
    "I want to try making a baby." Ryan felt blown away. He couldn't explain why he felt blown away but he did. He shook his head to clear it and just looked at her. She wanted him to put his penis inside of her. She wanted to feel what it was like to make love, to really make love. . .Ryan was floored and he knew that his answer had to be no.
    </p>
    <p>
    "We. ..we can't Celeste you're too small and it'll hurt a lot and I don't. . .I don't want to make your first time a bad one. . I don't want to make you hate me."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste looked down between them and rested one of her hands on his erection touching it through his pants. Then she looked up at him and said, "But you want to try it right?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan swallowed and stroked one of her cheeks, "yes Celeste I suppose that I do want to try it. But. . .I can't bear the thought of hurting you like that!"
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste looked back down and said, "Would it really hurt a lot?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan nodded, "Yes, at first it would, maybe even the entire time. I won't lie to you. . .there is a possibility after your body has gotten use to my penis being inside that it will feel quite good. But the initial pain might be too much. . .you might only remember that. . ."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste rested one of her very tiny hands on his cheek and said, "I want to try. . .and I know that you care about me. I won't hate you because you caused pain when I wanted it as well. I know how much you love me. I can't explain it I'm just a kid after all I guess. . ."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan pulled her closer to him and softly whispered in her ear, "I can't explain it either Celeste and I am no kid. Love is what love is." He held her close to him for a long while weighing his own thoughts in his head. On one hand he would get to put himself inside of a ten year old girl, on the other hand it might hurt or damage Celeste beyond repair. Then again she did want it. . .he only thought about it for a little while before finally deciding. He picked Celeste up by putting one of his hands on her bottom and she warped her legs around him as he said, "we'll try it, but in the bedroom on the bed not in here. . .and I want to take it very slowly."
    </p>
    <p>
    In the bedroom he had Celeste sit on the edge of the bed and Ryan went down on his knees. He undid the laces on one of her tennis shoes and then the other one before pulling both shoes off. He pulled her socks off as well very slowly revealing her small tender feet. Softly he massaged them and as he did he said, "I want you to relax Celeste, just be really calm and don't be scared. I promise if you tell me to stop I will."
    </p>
    <p>
    She nodded and said, "I'll always trust you Ryan." He smiled and moved his hands up slowly on her legs. He rubbed over her calves feeling the shapely muscles and then up over her legs he rubbed before having her stand up. He turned her away from him as he undid the buttons on the back of her dress. Then slowly like he was performing some kind of ritual he undressed her. The dress fell to the floor leaving Celeste in only a pair of very light pink panties. She turned around to face him and though her face was slightly flushed he could tell by her posture that she was very sure of herself.
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan had seen Celeste in just panties, or no panties many times now. Usually when she stayed over with him she would just sleep in her panties. Always when she wanted him to lick or touch her she was naked. It was strange but every time he saw her naked body it was like he was seeing it again for the first time. Every time he touched her, or licked her, it was like he was doing it for the first time. This was how special Celeste was to him. As he pulled her panties down revealing her bald cunny to his eyes again Ryan knew that this was forever. There would be no one else to take Celeste's place. Maybe one day he would have another girlfriend her age, but it would never be the same. They say that one great love walks in your life and everything else is put on hold. . .well she had walked into his and one day he knew she would walk out the door.
    </p>
    <p>
    He pushed that away, this wasn't about the future, this was about the here and now. With her panties off Celeste stood before her twenty-six year old lover (who would soon be twenty-seven in may). Ryan stood up and pulled his shirt over his head. He had only been wearing a pair of boxers and his cock was standing up in them throbbing with its desire to be set free. Celeste did not surprise him when she pulled at his boxers dragging them down for him.
    </p>
    <p>
    She still seemed fascinated by his penis every time she saw it, probably because she didn't have one of her own. He picked her up again laying her down on the bed and joined her. He laid beside Celeste on his side and rested a hand on her stomach. Softly he traced the contours of her stomach running his fingers over it and then he kissed her lips. Everything was done very slowly, almost as if they were in some slow motion movie. His hand moved down running over her legs softly feeling them and then his lips met one of her nipples.
    </p>
    <p>
    He sucked on the nipple and as he did Celeste gave a small little moan. She was feeling the pleasure of the moment he was certain. His hand slipped between her legs rubbing up against her cunny and as he did Celeste cried out again. Slowly he worked her up helping her little body come to life. He moved down with his lips running them over her stomach amazed at how alive she was starting to feel.
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste moaned loudly as he continued to apply pressure with his fingers to her cunny. He moved down between her legs with his mouth licking and sucking on her clit and the inner folds of her cunny. Celeste was feeling something for sure. Her entire body was alive with her pleasure, pushing up against his mouth. Ryan knew that she was approaching her own Nirvana and that this was the only chance he was going to get.
    </p>
    <p>
    HE moved back up until he was beside her again and after kissing her lips a few times he said, "Are you certain that you want to go through with this?" Celeste nodded and Ryan knew that was the only answer he was going to get. He would have preferred for her to be on top, for her to take the course, but he knew that she wasn't ready for that. She wanted him to reassure her, to guide her into this new level and he knew that she wanted it done as intimately as possible. He took a pillow and slipped it under her lower back lifting her up a little. Then Ryan moved between her legs.
    </p>
    <p>
    It wasn't like he just shoved himself in. He started slowly rubbing the head of his erection along the lips of her sex. Celeste looked down at where he was and gave a few small whimpers of pleasure as he pushed the head of his erection against her clit. Finally when he could feel her juices coating the head of his erection and some of his pre-cum leaking out onto her cunny Ryan knew it was time to begin. He gently squeezed each of Celeste's legs and said, "You ready to try?"
    </p>
    <p>
    The newly turned ten year old opened her sky blue eyes and looked at him. She met his eyes and then nodded. She did not close her eyes as he pushed against her. Instead her eyes seemed to stay focused on his own. The head of his cock pushed against the smallest hole he had ever felt and nothing happened. HE could feel his penis pushing against it but nothing was happening. Celeste grunted in slight pain and Ryan stopped pushing.
    </p>
    <p>
    He leaned over and kissed her lips once lightly as he said, "Do you want to try again?" She nodded and he rubbed her cheek with one of his hands, "you are so brave my little one. This time try pushing back with me okay?" She nodded and he could see it in her eyes, her desire to be "one" with him. That was why she wanted this, she wanted to feel what it felt like to truly be with your lover. Ryan swallowed knowing now that he even had more to live up to.
    </p>
    <p>
    He began to push again, feeling the head of his penis being squished by the small hole, but it wasn't giving, he wasn't going in. Celeste started to push back against him and that was when it happened. Perhaps her pushing, inviting him in did it, or perhaps the slickness that was building up did it. Ryan wasn't sure all he knew was that he felt the small hole give. It opened up slowly around the head of his erection and as it did Celeste groaned loudly in slight pain. Her little cunny was being stretched like it wasn't suppose to be yet.
    </p>
    <p>
    He wanted to stop, he almost started to pull back but Celeste sensing his reluctance shook her head and said, "don't stop." Ryan could only oblige her wishes. Why it was so important to her that they sleep together now he wasn't sure but he knew that if she wanted it he wasn't going to argue with her about it. He pushed into her again and felt the head of his penis starting to slip in.
    </p>
    <p>
    It was so tight slipping into her!! Her cunny felt like some kind of a little vise that just wanted to squeeze him back out of her. That was what it was doing trying to push back at his erection. The hole was spreading open letting him in, and he could tell Celeste was feeling a mixture of pain and pleasure. Her little body was in sensory overload. He couldn't believe he was doing this, having sex with a ten year old. As her cunny let up on his penis Ryan pushed and felt the head slip in further. Then the whole head of his erection was inside of her cunny. He could feel the entrance way into the hole squeezing down tightly right there below the end of the head of his penis. Ryan grunted and almost lost his entire load as he tried to keep calm and stay there for her.
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan stopped moving inside of Celeste. HE ran his hands over her legs softly rubbing them and then up her sides as he leaned over her and kissed her deeply on the lips. Celeste's eyes were swimming with a mixture of pain and pleasure. They rested for a while like that the older man and preteen girl trying to keep their bodies balanced. Ryan moved slightly and as he did Celeste gave a small grunt. Her pleasure was building slowly now as was his own. Ryan didn't want this to end though. It was so amazing, being here inside of Celeste.
    </p>
    <p>
    He met her eyes again with his own and said, "We're going to try to move now okay?" Celeste nodded and Ryan moved. He pushed and felt his penis slip a little further in. Celeste pushed with him driving him into her bald cunny some more. The little girl was milking him now and he could see pleasure filling her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
    She groaned and said, "Oh wow!" He could see it now. He had rubbed over something inside of her cunny, a place of great pleasure. He pushed again and the head of his penis brushed against it again. Celeste cried out and pushed back against him driving him in a little further. Ryan couldn't believe how tight she was, in fact he was pretty sure that her tight cunny was the only thing preventing him from cuming now. Though he knew that he wasn't going to last much longer. She was moaning under him now with each push and though it was impossible for them to build up a real rhythm as she was still slightly too tight and he was still not use to her tight cunny.
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste moaned again and Ryan knew that she was cuming. Her orgasm was sudden and fierce. It filled her entire body she cried out and her cunny squeezed his penis like it had never been squeezed before. Ryan grunted and when her cunny released his penis it jerked and began to spill his seed into her cunny. He could feel each jerk as it went into her, and with each jerk Celeste moaned and again her orgasm began. Their bodies were responding to one another, over and over again as Celeste came Ryan emptied his seed into her.
    </p>
    <p>
    Finally his cum passed and Ryan breathing heavily slowly slipped his erection out of her cunny. He collapsed on the bed beside Celeste and loudly let out a rush of air from his lungs. He could hardly believe it, he had just made love to a ten year old. Not just that. . .the ten year old had actually enjoyed it. They laid in silence like that for a while until finally Ryan rolled onto his side.
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste opened her eyes sensing that he was there and smiled a little. Ryan stroked one of her cheeks, "how do you feel?" Celeste moved one of her legs and gave a slight sharp intake of breath. Ryan went down to where her cunny was and took a look. He didn't touch the mean red lips of her cunny but he knew that she had to hurt. Her hymen thankfully had not been intact or the pain would have been twice as bad. He slipped form the bed and went into the bathroom then came back out with a cool, wet washcloth. He gently placed it on the lips of her cunny and Celeste let out another air of breath as he said, "I'm sorry sweetie."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste shook her head and said, "It was so cool! I could feel you inside of me, filling me up with your babies. Is that what its supposed to feel like?" Ryan nodded and she hugged him suddenly and said, "I want to feel it again."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan chuckled and stroked her sides as he said, "Well we can try it again in a week or so if you want to Celeste." She just nodded and he laid on his back again letting her take up her usual spot. They laid like that, her head on his chest, his hand on her back as they talked softly. They talked about what they had just gone through, what it all meant. "So you enjoyed it?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste nodded, "Yeah, it hurt at first. . .but when I felt you going in, really going in I knew that I wanted you to do it. I wanted to feel what it was like. . .I wanted to know what it felt like for adult women."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan smiled, "well it feels different for most adult women sweetie. But now that your curiosity is satisfied what about next time?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste giggled, "Next time will be because I want to feel you trying to put your babies in me."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan chucked, perhaps he had used that phrase too much as she seemed to have picked it up from him. He either called it making love or making babies. Now apparently so did she. Ryan stroked her back and said, "I love you Celeste." She just mumbled back the same response before falling asleep. There was no doubt about it, over the next few days he could see it. She was growing more beautiful to his eyes. More aware of herself as well. She was becoming a young woman and it wasn't the sex that was making her one. She was smart, intelligent and one day she would want to experience what the rest of the world had to offer her. One day soon perhaps she would abandon him to try and find her own way in the world, and on that day everything inside of Ryan would break apart. . .

    Days turned into weeks, weeks into months, and before he could even think about it another year passed. Shortly after Celeste's tenth birthday her mother bought a house, nothing big, just a small one story that was in a subdivision that would keep her daughter going to the same school as all of her friends. Ryan helped the Appletree's move into their new house and almost immediately he began to miss Celeste. There had been a comfort to having her so close that he could just about see her until it was time for her to go to bed. Now she was further away. He still watched her after school though now to make it easier some days it was at her house.
    </p>
    <p>
    If anything their displays of affection grew stronger because of this. Ryan was a tall man, an inch over six feet in height, Celeste was growing into a tall girl. At ten she had reached almost five feet, and by the end of the year when she turned eleven she would be five feet two inches. Ryan figured that when she stopped growing she would be around five feet seven or eight inches. A tall girl, but like her mom she would always be skinny. There was nothing wrong in Ryan's opinion with that, and he could see himself loving even the adult Celeste.
    </p>
    <p>
    They made love more than once, they held each other and just talked for hours on end. Every second he got to spend alone with Celeste was amazing. At eleven her friends started to become slightly interested in boys their own age. He could feel the tug already starting and he knew that Celeste would join her friends given time. Amanda started to develop breasts close to her eleventh birthday and Ryan knew from talking with Celeste that she wanted them as well, but she would never be as well endowed as her friend.
    </p>
    <p>
    At night she would call him and they would talk for a little while before she went to bed. Sometimes on the weekends they would talk over the computer. It was hard not having her in the apartment next to him, but Ryan had grown use to it. The summer of her eleventh birthday was spent mainly with just the two of them. Her best friend Amanda went out of town for the first two months of summer. Yet when Amanda came back Ryan knew that Celeste like any girl entering Jr. High was about to enter into a lot of changes. Life grew, life changed and Ryan knew that when Celeste asked he would have to let her go. She didn't really need someone to watch her after school anymore, in a sense Ryan had done his job too well. He had helped Celeste adjust to the world around her.
    </p>
    <p>
    He could remember a night shortly after her eleventh birthday when they had finished making love Ryan had held her tightly against him not wanting to let go. Celeste sometimes had the ability to sense when something within him was wrong and this time was no different. Quietly with her head resting on his chest, still her favorite place to be she had said, "I'll always be right here," as she said this her hand rested on his chest indicating his heart. Ryan had smiled and stroked her back. In every sense eleven year old Celeste and Nine year old Celeste had a lot in common body wise. Yet still she was growing up and he knew what that meant.
    </p>
    <p>
    He had worked his way up in his job, now he was a supervising manager for six other managers in and around the city. His work load was slightly bigger, but easier to manage as well. He spent three days out of the week working and the rest was his to do with as he wished. As the summer went along Ryan began to spend more time with Celeste, taking her places. He just enjoyed being in her company, holding her hand, and kissing her. If it lead to more (often it did now) then he accepted that. Celeste had learned the joys of her body, learned what it all meant, and she wasn't going to stop just because society said it was wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
    There was change though. When Amanda came back at the end of summer Celeste began to spend some time with her friend. Amanda now wore an a-cup bra and Ryan wondered how big the little girl was going to get up there. Not that she did anything for him, not with the way she was growing anyways. Amanda over the summer had found out about the joys of kissing a boy, yea that's right a boy. He found out from Celeste that Amanda had made out with a boy two years older than her. Ryan knew it was coming soon.
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste wasn't going to break up with him because she stopped loving him. No, that wasn't ever going to be possible. Their love for one another would always be there though he knew that on her side of it at least it would change. Ryan was twenty-eight years old, she was eleven there was a gap there that could perhaps never be bridged. While at nine that gap hadn't mattered now it would. Celeste would want to go on double dates with her friends, she would want to have a boyfriend that in public she could kiss. She would want things that he couldn't give her, and inside of him it was tearing him up, though he never showed it to Celeste.
    </p>
    <p>
    "It has to be hard for you watching her grow up," He was sitting at the kitchen table in the Appletree house with Helen a few days before summer break ended. "I mean for me it was hard watching you with her, showing her what only you could have shown her." Helen put the cup of coffee down before him before taking her own and said, "You nurtured her in ways that I never could have. In her heart she will always hold you especially close and if one day in the future she told me she was marrying you I wouldn't be surprised."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan sipped on his cup and said, "the gap is already there, I wonder sometimes if she sees it or not. . .if that's why its gotten so intense lately. . ."
    </p>
    <p>
    Helen didn't gasp or even looked shocked anymore about this twenty-eight year old man sleeping with her eleven year old daughter. Two years changed a lot of things, including even Helen herself. "She sees it just as you do Ryan. She's desperate to hold onto that one thing in her childhood that made all the sense in the world, and that one thing is you. She knows because of you what love is like, she knows because of you how she's supposed to be treated by a boy. She also knows that she has to be a young woman now, that she has to spread her wings. . .and you have to let her."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan sighed, "I know. I've known for a year now. You know its funny I've talked to a lot of others like me. Some have had relationships just as intimate as mine is with Celeste, some have not. They all tell the same story though, eventually it comes to an end, and usually its her that does the ending. I can't take her to the next step, no matter how much I want to. I can't hold her, keep her here it would be too cruel. The world is huge, she has to see it with her own eyes, not with me, or even you guiding her."
    </p>
    <p>
    Helen smiled, "now you know how hard that decision of mine was to let you and my daughter keep being with one another." She paused standing up and squeezing one of Ryan's shoulders as she said, "I don't regret my decision and just by watching her grow you will see that you don't regret yours either." Ryan had left a little bit after that. The talk with Helen had not helped at all, but at least she had tried to help. Talking online with others like him who had gone through similar things did not help either. Talking to Celeste about it would have just made it worse.
    </p>
    <p>
    It came two weeks after school began. Ryan had given her the space she needed and they had only seen each other a total of four times those first two weeks. In the course of a year from shortly after her tenth birthday to the entire summer after her eleventh birthday Ryan had made love, actually penetrated Celeste a total of ten times. Most of the time they just had oral sex and it wasn't because she didn't enjoy full intercourse. It was just not something that they needed all the time to express their love for one another. Plus now that she was eleven he was a little bit scared of getting her pregnant.
    </p>
    <p>
    He was working that afternoon on his computer trying to finish the last few files for work when there was a knock at his apartment door. Ryan had thought about moving, maybe getting a real place of his own that he owned, but he hadn't done it yet. He sighed getting up and answering the door. He was a little surprised to see Celeste standing there because he had not been expecting her today. She was dressed in a dark black tee-shirt with the word Sweet written on the front of it and a pair of shorts that stopped at about the middle of her thighs. Ryan would give one thing to Celeste growing up, her slender legs had become longer and more shapely but still looked far skinner than most girls around her age did.
    </p>
    <p>
    She looked up at him and after he had closed the door she pulled him down to her. They kissed for a long time and while their tongues were tangling Ryan felt something wet on one of his cheeks. He pulled back and saw that Celeste was crying. She wiped at her eyes stubbornly and Ryan softly reached out stroking one of her shoulders as he said, "What's wrong sweetie?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste looked up at him and said, "c. . .could you ever hate me?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan swallowed and took her hand leading her over to the couch they sat together her on his lap facing him. Softly he rubbed one of her cheeks and said, "No I could never hate you Celeste." He had known that this was coming, he had known! It didn't help him at all. He could feel his own tears somewhere back there in the back of his head, yet he knew that they couldn't be shed not yet.
    </p>
    <p>
    She sniffed and more tears rolled down her cheeks as she said, "I. . .I do love you so much Ryan. . .it. . .it hurts."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan softly stroked her cheek and said, "just tell me Celeste, I'm big, I'm strong I can take it."
    </p>
    <p>
    She shook her head and said, "inside you're breaking all to pieces. Why didn't you tell me that you knew this would happen!" She was crying now and he tried to hold her but she pushed away getting off of his lap. She sniffed trying to stop her tears and said, "I. . .I don't know how to do this. I feel like. . .like. . .like I'm breaking up inside."
    </p>
    <p>
    God he wanted to tell her not to do it, he so wanted to. Yet he knew. "Celeste," She looked at him, and he felt tears on his own cheeks as he said this, "I know why you have to do this, and I know that you have to do it." He stood up walking over to where she was and put his hands on her shoulders as he said, "I will always love you, I will always be here for you." He softly stroked one of her cheeks, "We'll still see each other as often as you want to. I'll be your friend, one that you can come to with any problem. But you have to do this. . .I can't be the one to break your heart."
    </p>
    <p>
    She sobbed once as she said, "But it is breaking."
    </p>
    <p>
    "I know. . ."
    </p>
    <p>
    "I love you."
    </p>
    <p>
    He stroked her cheek, "I'll always love you as well Celeste."
    </p>
    <p>
    She hugged him once and then stepped back slightly. He could see the determination inside of her, the need to be strong. She wiped at her eyes once and said, "I. . .I need to be with people my own age, date boys my own age so that I can be with my friends and not feel like an outsider. I have to be a girl. . ."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan held back his pain, all of his hurt, his need to just hold her all of it. Softly he stroked one of her cheeks and said, "Go be one Celeste. Just remember something. . .I will always be here waiting for you. When you need me, when you want someone to help you understand something I will be here." Celeste hugged him once deeply and he stroked her back before she pulled away. She looked up at him once then walked to the apartment door. Ryan didn't turn around but he did say, "How will you get home?"
    </p>
    <p>
    "My mom is outside waiting for me." Ryan nodded and then he heard the door close. His heart broke then. He supposed that it had to happen. He broke down into tears, crying as he had not done since he had been a little boy. He cried for a very long time then somehow despite his grief he managed to push it back and go to his computer and do work. He was checking his e-mail when he saw it. An E-mail from Celeste. It had been sent a few hours ago when he opened it all it said was: No regrets ever about the time I spent with you.
    </p>
    <p>
    It was hard, it was so hard sometimes that he didn't even want to get out of bed. Yet he did, he struggled along. A couple of months went by when he heard nothing from Celeste. He had expected this though. She was trying to adjust just as he was. It was going to be hard. Her mom talked to him often telling him how her school work was going, and how she seemed to be getting better. He learned from her mother close to thanksgiving time that Celeste was "seeing" a boy named Frank who was a little bit on the chubby side but so very nice to her. She didn't teach him anything about sex as far as Helen could tell, all she did was maybe kiss with him. They "dated" until Christmas time. Then it just sort of ended.
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan found a beautifully hand sculpted dragon for Celeste for Christmas. She had grown to love dragons just as much as castles for some reason. It was still hard for him and that Christmas was no exception. They talked now though on occasion and she said that most the boys her age were interested in breasts and nothing else. Yet still she was changing, become more of who she would be. Her twelfth birthday came and passed and Ryan found himself moving on with his life. There was a very cute little four year old that lived in the apartment complex and he kept bumping into her and that started off a new friendship with the young girl's parents. Yet even though he adored the four year old and did get to spend some time with her and make her giggle he didn't love her the way that he had Celeste.
    </p>
    <p>
    It was the second month of summer and Ryan was working on closing the final deal on his own personal house. He was finally getting out of this apartment and into his own house, just a year shy of his thirtieth birthday. He was working on packing a box when someone knocked on his door. He figured that it was either Ginger or her husband needing to borrow something or for him to watch their daughter for a little bit. What he didn't expect was who greeted him on the other side of the door. They still talked on occasion but he hadn't actually seen Celeste since Christmas.
    </p>
    <p>
    She had changed, she was taller now, slightly over five feet in height. She was still as skinny as ever though. She wore a tight half top that clung against two very small little sprouts about the size of grapes and showed off her flat stomach with its still slightly outward bellybutton. She wore a tennis skirt as well that stopped at a little above mid thigh. Her sandy blonde hair was pulled behind her ears but not held in place by anything. He was speechless, she was still so beautiful. Her soft light blue eyes seemed to catch the sun, and her skin was so perfectly white. Her small turned up nose scrunched when she smiled. "Hi," he said like an idiot.
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste said, "My mom told me you were moving into a house."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan gestured for her to come in and she did closing the door behind her. "Yeah, I finally broke down and did the sensible thing." She smelled wonderful too, there was not a hint of makeup on her either, she was just the same plain and beautiful Celeste. Her legs seemed to go on forever. Still she had to look up to meet his eyes. It felt awkward having her here he decided. "How have you been doing?"
    </p>
    <p>
    She walked over to where his bookcase was and looked through the books as she said, "I've been okay I guess."
    </p>
    <p>
    He could sense it, "what's wrong?"
    </p>
    <p>
    She turned away from the book case and her eyes met his as she said, "I miss you. I lay awake in bed sometimes and think about what you're doing. Then I want to be here with you, let you touch me again. I. . .I tired it with a boy around my age. . .he was two years older. He was so clumsy and didn't even want to put a condom on until I made him. That was before I got on the pill. . ."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan swallowed, "you're having periods?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste blushed a little and said, "Yes I started in April. Got on the pill in June."
    </p>
    <p>
    "And you're telling me this because?"
    </p>
    <p>
    She walked over to where he was and said, "When I was nine you use to touch me, it made me feel special inside. The way that you held me, the way that you kissed me. . .all of it made me feel special. Sometimes. . .I think that no boy will ever make me feel like that. Yet I know. . .that I have to find that out for myself." She took one of his hands placing it on one of her shoulders and said, "I was thinking though that for one day out of the summer. . .that you could make me feel special again."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan's hand moved up from her shoulder softly stroking her cheek and he felt it, there inside of himself. That part of him that Celeste had found. That part of him that so deeply loved this little beauty. He leaned down and lightly kissed her lips. The kiss was light for only a second, then full blown passion missing for almost over a year now seemed to just take hold of both of them. Her tongue was in his mouth in a matter of second as her hands began to undo his shorts. Ryan didn't argue with her, he lifted her in his arms carrying her to the bed room.
    </p>
    <p>
    There they stood kissing each other as his hands took hold of her half top. He broke the kiss long enough to push the top up over her head and take in those little swells on her chest. Celeste blushed and said, "Well?" Ryan used his thumbs to feel the little bumps and Celeste giggled a little when he rubbed them. Then their kisses were back again. As she undid his shorts pulling them down with his boxers Ryan felt his penis throbbing already. She put her hand around it stroking and said, "its still as I remember. . ."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan picked her up laying her down on the bed as he pulled at his own shirt. He laid beside her lifting the skirt up and took in her panties, he swallowed and took hold of her panties dragging them down. Her cunny was as bald as he remembered, the little lips so perfectly formed already glistened with her desire. He undid the skirt and pulled it off as well before putting his hand on her stomach. Softly he stroked her stomach and kissed her lips as he said, "you're still as beautiful as that first day I saw you."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste smiled and pulled at his penis seeming to pull it against her cunny. Ryan couldn't deny her. If she wanted him inside he would give in. He climbed on top of her and Celeste spread her legs letting him. Her eyes met his as he pushed against the lips of her sex. He felt her cunny spreading open around his erection as the head of his penis pushed against the entrance to her body Celeste moaned slightly and pushed back against him. He pushed into her feeling that tight little hole surround his erection. He tried to keep his penis under control, to keep himself from cuming but already he was so close.
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste pressed up against him holding him tightly and Ryan gasped when she pushed on his erection driving him in further. Slowly they began working together, their bodies joined once more. This was how it had always been the two of them loving one another like this. It felt like the entire year of them apart had disappeared. It was as if once again they were together. Ryan could feel her pushing against him, he could hear her gasping. Her tight little cunny surrounded his erection and all he could do was cry out to Celeste as he pushed into her one last time and began to empty his seed into his twelve year old lover. Celeste cried out as well and then began to cum. She held him tightly her fingernails digging into his back as she came just as intensely as he had.
    </p>
    <p>
    He finally collapsed on the bed beside her breathing heavily. They stayed like that for a long while him laying on his side her on her back. Ryan softly stroked her stomach and lightly kissed her lips. His mouth moved down to one of the little grapes and he gently started sucking. As he teased the little bit of flesh and nipple Celeste said, "can we start talking to one another more often again?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan stopped sucking and looked up at her, "We can do anything you want us to do Celeste."
    </p>
    <p>
    She blushed and put her hand on his shoulder pushing him back until he was laying on the bed. "Anything?" He nodded and she climbed on top of him. It didn't surprise him when he felt her cunny starting to surround his erection again. This time though the feverish pace of before had ended. She slowly started to ride him and as she did Ryan ran his hands up her sides and then over those little bumps feeling them. She leaned down closer to him and said, "I'm thinking about trying out for the cheerleaders." Ryan just chuckled and rubbed her back as she said, "Will you come see some of the games?"
    </p>
    <p>
    "I. . I will, oh god Celeste don't do that!" She had taken all of his erection inside and started squeezing on it. How she had learned to do that he still wasn't certain but it was something she had been doing since their second time making love. She smiled and slowly began riding him again. Their pace built up together quickly as both of them reached towards another orgasm. Celeste began cuming before he did this time and Ryan groaned as he pushed up against her and began filling her again with his seed. HE held her tightly as he came inside of her tight little cunny.
    </p>
    <p>
    They laid there like that joined together for a few hours talking softly about the things that had happened in the past year. He dropped her off at home a few hours later and she kissed him for a very long time in the front foyer of her house. Celeste headed upstairs and Ryan saw Helen sitting on the living room couch. She smiled and said, "Broken fences may have some holes but they can easily be fixed."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan chuckled, "she has changed so much, grown so much in just a year."
    </p>
    <p>
    Helen stood up and said, "She's changed, but she's still the same girl that you fell in love with. You'll see that now that the two of you are going to be spending more time together again." And they did as well. It wasn't dating, as they never made love again after that night. It was just a need to be with one another. They talked, often, about anything. Ryan discovered that Helen was right, this was still the same Celeste. She had missed him in her life. She had needed him, not the same as before, but still she had needed him.
    </p>
    <p>
    He watched her grow, he was there for every bit of growth. Sometimes she would catch him looking at her and if they were at her house or at his house she would drag him into a bedroom. Sometimes their touches became more and he found himself once again inside of Celeste. He still loved looking at little girls, and on occasion when they were out she would point a little cute girl out to him almost as if she was teasing him. Yet they never really dated again. He saw her date, watched her take boys her own age out on dates. Nothing serious though ever developed. She was approaching fourteen and still even now as she got ready to turn fourteen Ryan saw inside of that late teen the nine year old he had met nearly nine years earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
    He still yearned for her, he still loved her so deeply sometimes it shocked him! She was beautiful, and she still turned his eyes when she walked in or out of a room. Ryan knew that he was still head over heels in love with her. . .yet how did she feel about him? He knew that he had to find that out. So he did the only thing he could do. He asked Celeste how she felt about him and her answer left him with no more surprises. . .

    </p>
    <p>
    The wedding dress was draped beautifully on her. It clung at the top slightly onto her small apple sized breasts pushing them up and out a little making them look slightly bigger than they really were. The veil she wore was draped over her face, yet even though it was down you could see her face clearly. The dress was of the most beautiful design. Her sandy blonde hair was pulled back in the veil and her father had his arm threaded through hers. She had grown out of his usual age of attraction but she had not grown out of his heart. Celeste was still that beautiful nine year old he had met all those years ago. Now at eighteen she had just flowered into a woman from that child beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
    The wedding was filled with family from both the bride and groom. This wedding was the event of the year, one that so many had waited for. The truth was that to many this marriage had come as a surprise, including Celeste's father. No one had known that wasn't immediately close to Celeste. It was amazing how Ryan could still look at her and see how beautiful she was, he could still see inside of this young adult woman the child that he had loved so much.
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan watched her walk down the aisle and as she stepped up the steps the priest asked her father, "Who gives this woman away?"
    </p>
    <p>
    "Her mother and I do." Her father lifted the veil but did not say anything or even kiss his daughter instead he went and sat down. Ryan felt his heart beat faster. All those years ago, when she had been eleven and told him that it all had to end, he had known that either she would return to him or find someone else that meant more to her. He stood now taking her hand as the priest instructed and as he did he remembered. The priest began to talk and while Ryan's mind listened the other part of his mind flashed back to when Celeste was fourteen.
    </p>
    <p>
    They had remained very close friends from that summer when she was twelve and they had slept together again. It had been hard to keep her at arms length and he had learned that she did not want him to. They talked often, most nights in fact, and the two of them had a lot to say. During that first year when she would come over to his house (incidentally it was only two streets over from her own) she would sit on his lap not letting him hold her at arms length. On occasion (very rarely) they even had some sexual contact with one another. The love between them did not simply disappear it seemed to still be there in all of its glory.
    </p>
    <p>
    It was when Celeste was fourteen and just starting high school that things changed again. Ryan had been working on her computer, something had gone wrong with the mother board and he found himself installing a new one for her. Helen was not home and Celeste had been sitting on her bed watching him. He remembered that day so clearly that he could even remember what she was wearing. At fourteen Celeste was nearly five and a half feet in height most of which was very slender child-like legs. She had been wearing her cheerleader skirt that day, and she had been using it and her legs to purposefully tease him. A few times as he had asked her for something and looked at her to take it he had seen flash of white lace panties.
    </p>
    <p>
    She had also been wearing a tight halter-top that had formed around her small lemon sized breasts perfectly making Ryan want to just run his hands over them. Her sandy blonde hair as usual hung down far past her shoulders. She had looked simply beautiful and she had definitely been trying to turn him on. He finished putting the motherboard in and reconnecting the entire computer and as it loaded up he stood looking at her and said, "There you go sweetie its all set up again."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste smiled and said, "Come here. . ." Ryan had walked over to where she was and she had pulled him down to her. The kiss had been short at first, but then it had grown. Before Ryan knew it he had been on the bed, on top of Celeste his penis hardening. He could feel her small breasts pressing against him as their tongues tangled. He ran a hand up one of her sides and broke the kiss gently. Celeste's light blue yes me this and she said, "What's wrong?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan had moved his hand up and softly stroked one of her cheeks, "I still see that beautiful nine year old I feel in love with. . ."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste had smiled took his hand and put it on one of her breasts and said, "Does the older girl still turn you on?" Ryan had squeezed her breast and as he did he felt her hand move down to his pants and start to undo the button on them. Ryan had not argued with her as they undressed one another, pulling at each other's cloths. Ryan had reached under Celeste's skirt and pulled at her panties as she got him out of his boxers. He hadn't even bothered with her skirt, and she hadn't even bothered with getting her skirt off. Ryan had pushed against her and Celeste had taken him in. They had not made love that afternoon, they had had sex. It had been long, and it had been hard. It hadn't ended until they had both had their fill.
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan had rolled to lay on the bed beside her and Celeste had slipped her skirt off before rolling on top of him. Her small breasts had squished against him and she had lain there fully naked in his arms. They had talked long that afternoon. It was only a few short weeks until Celeste's fifteenth birthday and the two of them talked about that. They had been talking and Ryan had said, "I still do love you," as he stroked a hand down her back to her small very cupable bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
    That was when Celeste had surprised the hell out of him, "When I was eleven and ended it with you. . .I didn't know what I had, I mean I knew how much you loved me. I didn't understand it though. These past three years I have realized something. . .just how much you mean to me. With you here my life feels good, complete. . .and you make me feel so good when you make love to me. Here in your arms. . .it just feels right. I'm not impressed with the boys I tried to date. You however continue to fascinate me Ryan. I love you."
    </p>
    <p>
    He had won her back, somehow through it all she had come back to him. Their love became more. HE couldn't explain how, that nine year old was still there inside of her, but something else had emerged, a more confident teenage girl. She knew what she wanted and as the months passed he found out that she wanted him to be a little aggressive as well. She wanted him to initiate things, she wanted him to be a part of the relationship now. The two of them were in it together now, they shared the same footing, the same understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
    By the time she was sixteen Ryan knew that he wanted to marry Celeste. That he wanted to spend every waking day with her. Every hour that he could possibly be with her. He told Helen before he told Celeste, it was the right thing to do, to get Helen's permission. He remembered that as well. He had sat down with her one afternoon before Celeste got home from her friend Amanda's and said, "I want to marry Celeste."
    </p>
    <p>
    Helen had not looked shocked she had just calmly said, "I knew that this was coming believe it or not. I am not blind to the two of you. It has grown hasn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan smiled, "its grown more than I could have ever imagined Helen. The two of us belong together."
    </p>
    <p>
    Helen had smiled and rubbed his hand as she said, "I know, I knew years ago. It just took her awhile to understand what it all meant. Ask her, I know what she will say."
    </p>
    <p>
    A day later Ryan had taken Celeste to a restaurant and the two of them had talked and had fun together as always. Yet when he had been walking with her back to the car Ryan had surprised her with a sudden change. He had gone down on one knee before her and said, "Celeste I want you to marry me, not today, not tomorrow, perhaps a couple of years from now. . .but I want you to be my wife."
    </p>
    <p>
    She had accepted, she had taken the ring, and then her tears had begun. They had made love that night unlike any night before it. It had only increased as the months passed. Their love for one another had grown as well in the coming months. Celeste finally told her best friend just how much he meant to her. Amanda was surprised but accepting. Now two years after he proposed Ryan stood before Celeste holding her small delicate hands in his.
    </p>
    <p>
    They said their "I Do's" and kissed one another. It was not a simple peck on the lips, this was a full blown kiss, their tongues meeting. The reception was like any reception. They danced together and as he held her closely in his arms Celeste said, "I want to take this school year off from college just spend it with you."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan had softly kissed her lips and said, "We'll be living together Celeste we will have plenty of time together."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste had remained a mystery about that the rest of the night. Then after they laid in bed together holding one another she brought it up again. They were in a hotel bedroom waiting for the next morning when they would head to Europe. Laying together they held one another and Celeste again said, "I want to take a year off before going to college. Maybe even two years."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan softly stroked her back as he said, "Do you know what the odds are of someone taking two years off before going to college are towards them actually starting it?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste sighed and said, "I don't want to be away from the two of you at least not at first."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan smiled and said, "The two of us? Sweetie there are only two of us."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste sat up on top of him resting one of his hands on her lower stomach and said, "The two of you."
    </p>
    <p>
    It had dawned on Ryan then what she meant. Softly he rubbed her stomach and said, "You're with child?"
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste leaned down and lightly kissed his lips as she said, "I do know how they are made." Softly she moved on top of him and said, "It was an accident and I didn't realize until a few days ago that it was even possible. I had just thought that I had missed my period because of my nerves."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan stroked her back, "You amaze me everyday, every year, every time I walk into a room and you are there its like time just stands still. Back then when you were nine, and even now you're still that same incredible little girl I met."
    </p>
    <p>
    Celeste smiled, "I still remember the first day that we met, how you seemed to understand me so easily. You made me feel so beautiful and you made me feel loved. I remember the first time that you touched me, the first time that I asked you to. You loved me and I loved you even then. I didn't understand it. . .but now I do. Now I know how much you mean to me. Now I understand what it was that you gifted me with. Not our child. . .though that is a gift, its not the one I mean."
    </p>
    <p>
    Ryan softly stroked one of her cheeks and said, "I love you every day it amazes me how much I love you. We'll work it all out Celeste, as we always have." And that they did together holding hands they walked into a new life that they had begun building together when Celeste was nine and when one Little Girl lover was desperately trying to find his own way in the world. . .they had found each other and together they could and would face anything. . .
